199,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Letter from Newton to a friend, together with Collins's description of a telescope mentioned in the Newton letter",MS Add. 9597/2/18/3,23 February 1668/9,England,"['English', 'Latin']","3 Trinity College Cambridge Feb: 23d 16689 Sir I promised in a Letter to Mr Ent to give you an accompt of my Successe in a small attempt I had then in hand, And it is this; being perswaded of a certaine way whereby the Practicall part of Opticks might be promoted I thought it best to proceed by degrees and make a Small Prospective first to try whether my coniecture would hold good or not, The Instrument that I made is but Six Inches in Length, it beares something more then an Inch apperture, and a Plano=convex eye glasse whose depth is an o 16 or 17th part of an Inch, Soe that it Magnifies about 40 times in Diameter which is more then any 6 foote Tube can doe I beleeve with distinctnesse. But by reason of bad Materialls and for want of Good Pollish it represents not things so distinct as a 6. foote Tube will doe, yet I thinke it will discover as much as any 3. or 4. foote Tube especially if the Objects be Luminous; I have seen with it Iupiter distinctly round and his Satellites, and Venus horned. Thus Sir I have given you a short accompt of this small Instrument, which though in it selfe contemptible may yet be looked upon as an Epitome of what may be done according to this way, for I doubt not but in time a Six foote Tube may be made after this Method which will Performe as much as any 60. or 100. foote Tube made after the Common way; Whereas I am Perswaded that were a Tube made after the Common way of the Purest Glasse, exquisitly Pollished with the best figure that any Geometrician (Des=Cartes &c) hath or can designe (which I beleive is all that men have hitherto attempted or wished for) yet such a Tube would scarce performe as much more as an ordinary good Tube of the same length; And this however it may seeme a Paradoxicall assertion, yet it is the Necessary consequence of some Experiments which I have made concerning the Nature of Light. The above is Coppy of a Letter of a Letter written by Mr Newton to a freind of his The Tellescope therein mentioned hath been te lately sent up to the Royall Societie, who gave Mr Cox order to make one after the same manner of Contrivance 4 foot long the which hath been done: one end of the tube is open, at the other end is placed a Concave Mettalline Mirrour, the Diameter whereof is betwixt 4 and 5 Inches it was ground on a Sphære of 14 foot Diameter and about its focus which is about 4 foot off is placed a reflecting Plate as big as a two pence inclined at an angle angle of 45 degrees to the Axis, so that the reflected Rayes falling thereon, are againe reflected upright to the side of the Tellescope, where the eye through a small hole wherein is placed a small Plano Convex glasse beholds the Object on the reflecting Plate, as much magnified as it could have been done by an ordinary Tellescope of 40 foote long or more, and voyd of Colours: the Mirrour and reflecting Plate are made to be taken out, and wiped at pleasure: they are not yet pleased with the Mettall or Polish of the reflecting Plate, but are trying Lapis Osmandinus, a black Stone that comes from Mount Hecla in Island, and other Materialls whereof you may afterwards the s heare the Successe Mr Hooke,Hookes Tellescopes seeing this Tellescope to obtaine esteeme, about a Month since put in a Proposall in Writing to the Royall Societie in words to this effect The perfection of Tellescopes, Microscopes, Scotoscopes, and burning Glasses, by figures, as easily made, as those that are plaine, or Sphærericall, whereby the Light and Magnitude of Objects is prodigiously encreased and whatsoever hath hitherto been attempted or almost desired in Dioptricks accomplished, With a Cipher containing the Mysterie the which he disclosed to the Lord Brouncker, and Dr Wren, who report plausibly of it, and what is done in this way is performed by Glasse Refraction Mr Hooke moreover affirmed coram multis that in the yeare 1664 he made a little Tube of about an Inch long, to put in his fobb, which performes more than any Tellescope of 50 foot long made after the common manner; but the Plague happening, which caused his absence, and the fire, whence redounded profitable employments about the Citty, he neglected to prosecute the same, being unwilling the Glasse grinders should know any thing of the Secret, Gottignies as a iesuite writes me word hath Gottignies the Scholar of Gregory of St Vincent, whose remaines he hath, is said to have made wonderfull (but in what respect I know not) Tellescopes at Rome, and to have published a Treatise of Dioptricks there.

200,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Letter from Newton to Francis Aston, dated 18 May 1669",MS Add. 9597/2/18/4,18 May 1669,England,"['English', 'Latin']","4 Trinity College Cambridge May 18 1669 Francis: Since in your letter you give mee so much liberty of spending my Judgment about what may bee to your advantage in travelling, I shall doe it more freely then perhaps would otherwise have beene decent. First therefore I will lay down some generall rules most of which I beleve you have considered already; but if any of them bee new to you they may excuse the rest, if none at all yet tis my punisment more in writing them then yours in reading them. When you come into any fresh company, 1, observe their humours; 2 suit your own carriage thereto, by which insinuation you will make their converse more free & open: 3 let your discours bee more in Quærys & doubtings than peremptory assertions or disputings, it being the designe of Travellers to learne not teach; besides it will persuade your acquaintance that you have the greater esteem of them & soe make them more ready to communicate what they know to you; whereas nothing sooner occasions disrespect & quarrells then peremptorinesse. You will find little or noe advantage in seeming wiser or much more ignorant than your company. 4, seldome discommend any thing though never so bad, or doe it but moderatly, least you bee unexpectedly forced to an unhansom retraction. Tis safer to commend any thing more then it deserves then to discommend a thing so much as it deserves: a bad For commendantionscommendations meet not soe often with oppositions or at least are not usually so ill resented by men if that think otherwise as discommendations. And you will insinuate into mens favour by nothing sooner then seeming to approve & commend what they like; but beware of doing it by a comparison. 5 If you bee affronted, tis better in a forrain Country to passe it by in silence or with a jest though with some dishonour then to endeavour revenge; For in the first case your credit's ne're the wors when you return into England or come into other company that have not heard of the quarrell, but in the second case you may beare the marks of the quarrell while you live, if you out live it att all. But if you find your self unavoydably engaged tis best, I think, if you can command your passion & language, to keep them pretty eavenly at the some certain moderate pitch, not much heightning them to exasperate the adversary or provoke his freinds nor letting them grow overmuch dejected to make him insult. In a word if you can keep reason above passion, that & watchfulnesse will bee your best defendants. To which purpose you may consider that though such excuses as this [He provok't mee so much I could not forbeare] may passe amongst freinds yet amongst strangers they are insignificant & only argue a Travellers weaknesse. To these I may ad some generall heads for inquirys or observations such as at present I can think on. As 1 to observe the policys wealth & State affaires of nations so far as a solitary Traveller may conveniently doe. 2 Their impositions upon all sorts of People Trades or commoditys that are remarpkeable. 3 Their Laws & Customes how far they differ from ours. 4 Their Trades & Arts wherin they excell or come short of us in England. 5 Such fortifications as you shall meet with, their fashion strength & advantages for defence; & other such military affaires as are considerable. 6 The power & respect belonging to their degrees of nobility or Magistracy. 7 Wh you c It will not bee time mispent to make a Catalogue of the names & excellencys of those men that are most wise learned or esteemed in any nation. 8 Observe the Mechanisme & man̄nner of guiding ships. 9 Observe the products of nature in severall places especially in mines with the circumstances of mining & of extracting metalls or mineralls out of their oare and refining them and if you meet with any transmutations out of one species into another (as out of Iron into Copper, out of any metall into quicksilver, out of one salt into another or into an insipid body &c) those above all others will bee worth your noting being the most luciferous & many times lucriferous experiments too in Philosophy. 10 The prizes of diet & other things. 11 & And the staple commoditys of Places. These Generalls (such as at present I could think of) if they will serve for nothing else yet they may assist you in drawing up a Modell to regulate your Travels by As for particulars these that follow are all that I can now think of, viz: Whither at Schemnitium in Hungary (where there are Mines of Gold, copper, Iron, vitrioll, Antimony, &c) they change Iron into Copper by dissolving it in a Vitriolate water which they find in cavitys of rocks in the mines & then melting the slymy solution in a strong fire which in the cooling proves copper. The like is said to bee done in other places which I cannot now remember. Perhaps too it may bee done in Italy; For about 20 or 30 years algone there was a certain Vitriol came from thence (called Roman Vitrioll, but of a nobler vertue than that which is now called by that name) which Vitrioll is not now to bee gotten becaus perhaps they make a greater gain by some such trick as turning Iron into Copper with it then by selling it. 2 Whither in Hungary, Sclavonia, Bohemia neare the town Eila, or at the Mountains of Bohemia neare Silesia there be rivers whose waters are impregnated with gold; perhaps the Gold being dissolved by som corrosive waters like Aqua Regis & the solution carried along with the streame that runs through the mines. And whither the practise of laying mercury in the rivers till it be tinged with gold & then straining the mercury through leather that the gold may stay behind, bee a secret yet or openly practised. 3 There is newly contrived in Holland a mill to grind glasses plane with all & I think polishing them too, perhaps it will bee worth the while to see it. 4 There is in Holland one — Bory, who some yeares since was imprisoned by the Pope to have extorted from him some secrets (as I am told) of great worth both as to medicine & profit, but hee escaped into Holland where they have granted him a guard. I think he usually goes clothed in green pray enquire what you can of him, & whither his ingenuity bee any profit to the Dutch. 5 You may inform your selfe whither the Dutch have any tricks to keep their ships from being all worm eaten in their voyages to the Indys. Whither Pendulum clocks doe any service in finding out the longitude &c. I am very weary & shall not stayd to part with a long complement only I wish you a Good Iourney & God bee with you Is Newton. Pray let us heare from you in your Travells. I have given your 2 books to Dsr Arrowsmith.",NATP00227,1669-05-18 00:00:00
197,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Letter from Newton to John Collins, dated 19 January 1669/70",MS Add. 9597/2/18/1,19 January 1669/70,England,['English'],"1 Trinity College Cambridge. Ian 1669 Sir I received Dr Wallis his Mechanicks which you sent to Mr Barrow for mee. I must needs acknowledg you more then ordinarily obliging, & my selfe puzzeled how I shall quit Courtesys. The Problemes you proposed to mee I have considered & sent you here the best solutions of one of them that I can contrive; Namely how to find the aggregate of a series of fractions, whose numerators are the same & their denominators in arithmeticall progression. To doe this I shall propound two ways, The first by reduction to one common denominator as followeth. If ab . ab+c . ab+2⁢c . ab+3⁢c &c be the series: Multiply all their denominators together, & the product will bee b4+6⁢b3⁢c+11⁢b⁢b⁢c⁢c+6⁢b⁢c3 4321; each terme of which being multiplyed by its dimensions of b, & the product againe multiplyed by ab, the result shall bee the Numerator of the desired aggregate 4⁢a⁢b3+18⁢a⁢b⁢b⁢c+22⁢a⁢b⁢c⁢c+6⁢a⁢c3 b3+6⁢b3⁢c+11⁢b⁢b⁢c⁢c+6⁢b⁢c3 If ab−2⁢c . ab−c . ab . ab+c . ab+2⁢c, be the series: The factus of their denominators is binb⁢b−c⁢c‾inb⁢b−4⁢c⁢c, or b5−5⁢b3⁢c⁢c+4⁢b⁢c4, the denominator; which multiplyed as before gives 5⁢a⁢b4−15⁢a⁢b⁢b⁢c⁢c+4⁢a⁢c4, the Numerator of the aggregate. If ab−c . ab+c . ab+3⁢c &c is the series. Then b⁢b−c⁢c‾×b+3⁢c or b3+3⁢b⁢b⁢c−b⁢c⁢c−3⁢c3 is the denominator and 3⁢a⁢b⁢b+6⁢a⁢b⁢c−a⁢c⁢c the numerator of the Aggregate. In numbers: If 12.13.14.15.16 is the series, then putting b=2 that the series may bee 1b . 1b+1 . 1b+2 . 1b+3 . 1b+4 ; the factus of their denominators will bee b5+10⁢b4+35⁢b3+50⁢b⁢b+24⁢b the denominator, & consequently 5⁢b4+40⁢b3+105⁢b⁢b+100⁢b+24 the denominnumerator of the aggregate. But itsit is better to put the b=4, that the series may bee 1b−2 . 1b−1 . 1b . 1b+1 . 1b+2 . And so shall the aggregate bee 5⁢b4−15⁢b⁢b+4 b5−5⁢b3+4⁢b . The annexed table willmuch faciliateye multiplicationof denominators together. +1−1 +1−5+4 +1−14+49−36 +1−30+273−820+576 +1−55+1023−7645+51276−14400 b11. b9⁢c⁢c. b7⁢c4. b5⁢c6. b3⁢c8. b⁢c10 +1−55+1023−7645+51276−14400 for 3 terms for 5 termes for 7 termes for 9 termes for 11 termes This rule holds good though the differences of the denominators bee not equall: as if ab+c . ab+d . ab−e are to bee added the factus of their denominators is b3+b⁢b⁢c+b⁢b⁢d−b⁢b⁢e+b⁢c⁢d−b⁢c⁢e−b⁢d⁢e−c⁢d⁢e the denominator, which multiplyed by the dimensions of b & againe by ab produces 3⁢a⁢b⁢b+2⁢a⁢b⁢c+2⁢a⁢b⁢d−2⁢a⁢b⁢e+a⁢c⁢d−a⁢c⁢e −b⁢d⁢e the numerator of the desired summ. The other way of resolving this ProblemsProbleme is by approximation. Suppose the number of termes in the propounded series of bee p. And make p⁢p−p2=q. 2⁢p⁢q−q3=r. q⁢q=s. 6⁢q⁢r−r5=t. 4⁢q⁢s−s3=v. 12⁢r⁢s−5⁢t7=x. 2⁢s⁢s−v=y. r⁢v−r⁢s3+t=z. &c. Now if the propounded series bee ab . ab+c . ab+2⁢c . ab+3⁢c &c their Aggregate shall bee abinp−q⁢cb+r⁢c⁢cb⁢b−s⁢c3b3−t⁢c4b4 &c: In which progression the farther you proceede, the nearer you approach to truth. But itsit is better to put b for the Denominator of the middle termes of the propounded series, thus .ab−2⁢c . ab−c . ab . ab+c . ab+2⁢c. And making n the number of termes from the said middle terme either way; as also n⁢n+n=m. 2⁢n+1=p. m⁢p3=r. 3⁢m⁢r−r5=t. 3⁢m⁢m⁢r−5⁢t7=x. m3⁢r−2⁢m⁢m⁢r3+t=z. &c, the desired Aggregate shall bee abinp+r⁢c⁢cb⁢b +t⁢c4b4+x⁢c6b6+z⁢c8b8 &c: a progression wanting each other terme & also converging much more towards the truth then the former. Now a series of fractions being propounded: first consider how exact you would have their aggregate; suppose tnot erring from truth above 1e part of an unit. Then make a rude guesse how many times n⁢cb bn⁢c multiplyed into it selfe will bee about the bignesse of 5⁢a⁢e2⁢b more or lesse. And omit all those termes of the progression where b is of more then soe many dimensions. For example if the aggregate of 10000100+10000106+10000112+10000118+10000124+10000130+10000136 bee desired cto the exactnesse of 18th part of an unite Then is a=10000. b=118. c=6. n=3. e=8. bn⁢c=11818 or about 612. 5⁢a⁢e2⁢b=200000118 or about 1700; to which 612 square-squared or multiplyed 3 times into it selfe is about equall. Therefore I take only the two first termes of the rule abinp+r⁢c⁢cb⁢b: b in the rest being of above 3 dimensions. And soe making 2⁢n+1=7=p. & n⁢n+n3⁢p=28=r, the desired aggregate will bee ab×7+28⁢c⁢cb⁢b or 70000118in1406813924, wanting about an eighth part of an unit. But if an exacter aggregate bee desired, take another terme of the rule & the error will not bee above 1350 of an unit. Thus if the said series were continued to 21 termes 10000100 being the first, 10000160 the middle, & 10000220 the last terme: three termes of the rule would give an aggregate too little by about 12 of an unit, 4 termes by about 112 or 115 part & 5 termes by about 1100th part, or lesse. But perhaps it might bee more convenient to resolve this at twice, first finding the aggregate of the last eleven termes, & then of the next nine, & lastly adding the first terme to the other two aggregates. And this may bee done to about the 60th part of an unit by using onely the three first termes of the rule. From these instances may bee guessed what is to bee done in other cases. But it may bee further noted that it will much expedite the work to subduct the Logarithm of b from that of c and multiply the remainder by 2.4.6.8 &c which products shall bee the Logarithms of c⁢cb⁢b.c4b4.c6b6.c8b8 &c. whose computation in propper numbers would bee troublesom. This Probleme much resembles the squaring of the Hyperbola: That being only to find the aggregate of a series of fractions infinite in number & littlenesse, with one common numerator to denominators whose differences are equall & infinitely little. And as I referred all the series to the middle terme, the like may bee done conveniently in the Hyperbola. If AC AH are its rectangled Asymptotes & the area BDGE is desired: bisect BD in GC=b, make AC=a CF=b, & CD or CB=x. soe that a⁢ba+x=DG & a⁢ba−x=BE. Then according to Mercator the area GDCF is b⁢x−b⁢x⁢x2⁢a+b⁢x33⁢a⁢a−b⁢x44⁢a3 +b⁢x55⁢a4 &c. & the area BCFE is b⁢x+b⁢x⁢x2⁢a+b⁢x33⁢a⁢a+b⁢x44⁢a3+b⁢x55⁢a4 &c. And the summ of these two make the whole area BDGE= 2⁢b⁢x+2⁢b⁢x33⁢a⁢a+2⁢b⁢x55⁢a5 &c. Where each other terme is wanting, & x is lesse by half then it would otherwise have beene, which makes the series more converging toward the truth. As to your other Problem about the resolution of Equations by tables. There may bee such Tables made for Cubick equations; & consequently which shall serve for those of foure dimensions too: But scarcely for any others. Indeed could all Equations bee reduced to three termes only, tables might bee made for all: but that's beyond my skill to doe it, & beleife that it can bee done. For those of three dimensions there needs but one column of figures bee added to the ordinary tables of Logarithms, & the construction of it is pretty easy & obvious enough. If you please I will some time send you a specimen of its composition & use, but I cannot perswade my selfe to undertake the drudgery of making it. Your Kinck-Huysons Algebra I have made some notes upon. I suppose you are not much in hast of it, which makes me doe that onely at my leisure. Your obliged friend & Servant Is: Newton.

Sir Mr Barrow shewed mee some of your papers in which I was much pleased at Monsieur Cassinis invention for finding the Apogœa & excentricitys of the Planets For your Annuity Problem I have sent you the following solution to consider of what use it b may bee. To know at what rate (N per cent) an Annuity of B is purchased for 31 yeares at the price A. The rule is 6Log: of31BA 100−50Logof31BA = Log: of100+N100 . As for example if 1200li‾ bee payd at present for 100li‾ yearely for 31 yeares then is the Logarithm of 31BA=0,41218. And consequently by the rule 2,4730879,39100 or 0,03111 is the Logarithme of 100+N100; whence 100+N100=1,0743. And N=7,43 or 7li‾, 8s, 7d. Soe that the Annuity was bought at 7lib‾ the rate of 7lib‾. 8s, 7d per cent. This rule is not exact but yet soe exact as never to faile above 2d or 3d at the most when the rate is not above 16lib per cent. And if the rate bee above 16 or 18lib‾ per cent, or which is all one if A‾‾|‾‾ 6B, then this rule A+BA=100+N100 will not err above 2s. You may try the truth of these rules by the equation x32=A+BAx31−BA; putting 100+N100=x, & working in logarithms. You seeme to apprehend as if I was about writing elaborate Notes upon Kinck-huyson: I understood from Mr Barrow that your desire was only to have the booke reveived: that if any thing were defective or amisse it might be amended, & to that purpose about two Months since I reveived it & made some such observations upon it to that purpose. But though the booke bee a good introduction I think it not worth the paines of a formall comment, There being nothing new or notable in it which is not to bee found in other Authors of better esteelme. You make mention of another book of the same Author translated badly into latten by a German Gunner; which you would have mee correct. I understand not Dutch & would not willingly doe the Author soe much wrong as to undertake to correct a translation where I understand not the originall: I suppose there want not Mathematitians in London that understand Dutch. In finding the Aggregate of the termes of a Musicall Progression there is one way by Logarithms very obvious (viz by bysubducting the logarithms of each denominator from that of the Numerator &c) which I supposed to bee the ordinary way in Practise & therefore mentioned it not in my Letter.

Trinity College Sir I have here sent your Kink-Huysons Algebra with those notes which I have intermixed with the Authors discourse. I know not whither I have hit your meaning or noe but I have added & altered those things which I thought convenient to bee added or altered, & I guesse that was your desire I should doe. All & every part of what I have written I leave wholly to your choyse whither it shall bee printed together with your translation or not. what If you think fit to print any of it the directions I have writ in english will shew you where it is to bee inserted. But if you have a mind not to change the Author soe much, I would not have you recede from your intentions upon the accompt of what I have done. For I assure you I writ what I send you not so much with a designe that they should bee printed ats that your desires should bee satisfied to have me revise the booke. And so soone as you have read the papers I have my end of writing them. In a letter you hinted somthing to bee supplyed out of Ferguson's Labyrinthus about the extraction of cubick roots; if you meant pure rootes, I have done that in as breif plaine & full a manner as I can. But if you meant affected roots, tis already done by Kinck-Huyson pag 91 as well as by Ferguson. Indeed Ferguson seemes to have done more in so much as to comprehend all cases of cubick roots equations within the same rules; but that [more] is inartificiall because it supposes the extraction of cubick roots out of imaginary binomiums, which how to doe hee hath not taught us, his rule taught in pag 4 not extending to it. Thus his second example, 1æ=6⁢χ+4 supposeth the cubick roote of 2+−4 to bee extracted which indeed is −1+−1, but I would know by what direct method hee teacheth to find it. Not but that it may bee done, & I know how to doe it, but I think it not worth the inserting into Kinck huyson, yet if you think it convenient (& indeed it may bee congruently enough inserted into him at pag 91) I will send you it done in my next letter. There remains but one thing more & thats about the Title page if you print these alterations which I have made in the Author: For it may bee esteemed unhandsom & injurious to Kinck huysen to father a booke upo wholly upon him which is soe much alter'd from what hee had made it. But I think all will bee safe if after the words [nunc e Belgico Latinè versa,] bee added [et ab alio Authore locupletata.] or some other such note. Somthing I have yet to say & that's about your paper concerning the aggregate of the termes of a musicall progression: Namely your way deduced from Mercators squareing of the Hyperbola is the same with the last of those two I had sent you together before. Onely I had taken a greate deale of paines to bring it to such a forme might bee most convenient for practise & soe had made it soe intricate as to other respects that is noe wonder if you did not discerne its fountaine or by what method I had composed it. I begg you pardon therefore for that obscurity: but I have since committed a greater fault then that; & that's a neglect of writing to you, Yet I doubt not but that you have goodnesse enough to pardon all. In confidence of which I rest Your most humble Servant Is: Newton. I had sent your booke immediately upon the receipt of your letter but that I staid two or three days expecting to see Mr Pitts. As for the coppys of Kinck-huysen you mentioned to send to me, I know tis usually not without some unwillingnesse that Mathematical books are printed. And I would not soe far discourage the printing of it as to have any coppys reserved for mee. I had rather purchase your freinship then bookes. Yet if you please to send mee one coppy I shall acknowledg my selfe your debter for that together with Dr Wallis his Mechanicks & the rest, I. N.

Worthy Sir I sometimes thought to have altered & enlarged Kinkhuysedn his discourse upon surds but judging those examples I added would in some measure supply his defects I contented my selfe with doing that onely. But since you would have it more fully done, if the booke goe not immediately into the presse I desire you'le send it back with those notes I have made (since you are resolved to print them also) & I will doe something more to it or if you please to send all but the first sheete or two, while that other is in the press is printing, Ile reveiw the rest & not only supply the wants about surds but that about Æquations soluble by trisection, & somthing more I would say in the chapter [Quomodò quæstio aliqua ad æquationem redigatur.] that being the most requisite & desirable doctrine to a Tyro & scarce touched upon by any writer unles in generall circumstances bidding them onely Nota ab ignotis non discernere & adhibere debitum ratiocionium. As to Fergusons rendering the roots of Æquations soluble by trisection, his defect will appeare by example. Let us take his 2d x3=6⁢x+4, in pag 12. In order to solve this hee bidds extract the cubick root of these binomiums 2+−4, & 2−−4 To doe this his rule pag 4 is: "" Multiply the binomium by 1000, put in pure numbers &c: Now 2+−4in1000 makes 2000+−4000000, but to put this in pure numbers is impossible for −4000000 is an impossibele quantity & hath noe pure number answering to it. His rule therefore failes & The like difficulty is in his 3d example & in all other such cases. In generall I see not what hee hath done more then in Cardans rules. For in this instance Cardans rule will give you x==c:2+−4‾+c:2−−4‾. in which the only difficulty as before is to extract the rootes of the binomiums 2+−4 & 2−−4. Which roots indeed are −1+−1 & −1−−1, as he assignes them, but tells not how to extract them. Nor doe I see what hee hath done more then Descartes in his Solution of biquadratick Equations: for both goe the same way to worke in reducing them first to Cubick & then to quadratick æquation. Lastly I see not in what case his rules will render rothe roots of cubick or biquadratick Æquations in proprio genere where those of Cardan or Descartes will not.

Worthy Sir Perceiving by your last that you are willing to take some more paines at present with Kinckhuysen I remand the same, but doe not presse your selfe in time, your paines herein will be acceptable to some very eminent Grandees of the Royal Societie who must be made accquainted therewith, and forasmuch as Algebra may receive a further Advancement from your future endeavours (at one time or other) and that you are more likely than any man I know, herein to oblige the Republick of Learning give me leave to remind you of some discourse I had when I first had the happinesse of your accquaintance, I intimated that D P affirmed that he could most exactly limit any Æquation shewing what the Homogeneum must be to make any paire or paires of rootes gaine or loose their possibility, and Secondly that out of that doctrine of Limits, he could fill up (with no great toyle) Columnes containing all those rankes of rootes both negative and affirmative, I send you a Specimen hereof in Cubick Æquations that my meaning may be the better understood his way of doing it was not by depression as here but scandendo, the like in his limits, limiting precisely first quadratick Æquations, then Cubicks then Biquadraticks, then by ayd of these Columnes making the ordi rootes ordinates applyed either to the respective Homogenea, or to the rootes of those Homogenea according to the highest degree of degree of the high first tearme of the Æquatiōon find the Genius of Curves proper to Æquations of each kind passing through the tops of those Ordinates, this I mention not to put you to any trouble to undertake it, or out of a desire to doe it on my account, or when done that you should impart it, but as a thing that will advance the Science of Algebra and cleare up that which other Authors have pretermitted. One thing more Moreover you have happily found out a method of turning any Æquation of two tearmes besides the Homogeneum into an infinite Series, and the totall of some of the tearmes of that Series may be obtained by tables as a helpe Suppose we then that to such an Æquation as this a5±B⁢a=N I assume a ranke of Numbers rootes to be in Arithmeticall Progression and make up a Series of N or Homogenea Whose 5th differences will be equall first then I affirme thinke it will be hereafter prooved that if barely that rank of Homogenea were proposed to find what Æquations were common to the ranke to that ranke, there might be found 5 severall Æquations common thereto, and that each of these Æquations hath or at least may have as the Æquation may be put one ranke of rootes in Arithmeticall Progression and consequently that the differences of the rootes of each Æquation are Proportionall one to another But to returne into the Way, when I had Fergusons Papers, I only viewed his Examples and that cursorily, it seemes he soared but Icari fine to accomplish what Hudden promised page 503 de reduction ain annexis Geametriæ Cartesianæ, I scrupled his rootes of negative rootes of quadratick quantities, and imagined he freed himself from them that they expunged one another being affected with contrary Signes but conceited there might be more done in Cubicks then authors yet insist on, because Hugenius in libro de magnitudine Circuli divides a Sphære in a given reason by Trisection, and Lalovera in Elementis Tetragonismicis doth by by a Drame divides a Parabola (throughout Proportionall to a Sphere) by finding of 2 Meanes both bookes Dr Barrow can shew you are not both cases are wayes the Solution of the Cubick æquation of the same kind and for finding the rootes where trisection is used thus saythsee especially Du Laurens (which bookes Dr Barrow can shew you) page 205 206 207 that Author as also Lalover and Leotaud are deceased. Bartholinus in 1657 wrote a small booke intituled re de arte Analytica inveniendi omnia Problemata Proportionalium maximè harmonicorūum wherein (detecting some of Vietas errors) he treates of Cubick Æquations and of framing of rules for Binomiall rootes, wherein I beleive there is little new, but possible his mode of expressing himselfe may be pleasing, I have not the booke of my owne, but hope erelong to send you those Chapters transcribed.

Sir The receipt of your last letter staying mee from sending back your Kinck-Huysens Introduction, I have hitherto deferred writing to you, waiting for D Barrows returne from London that I might consult his Library about what you propounded in your last letter but one to mee concerning the solutions of Cubick æquations, before I sent you my thoughts upon it. And yesterday veiwing Hugenius de Quadratura circuli & Lalovera de Elementis Tetragonismicis I can not by that instance you gave mee out of those two compared together bee convinced that two meane proportionalls may bee found by trisecting an arch, or contrarily. Hugenius indeed divides a sphære in a given ratio by trisection & Lalover divides a certaine Parabolicall segment in a given ratio by two meane proportionalls prop 8 lib 4, but then the division of that segment & the sphære are not analogous. For suppose akd the parabola touched at its vertex by ae & that ik, ed are parallell to its diameter, then are aik aed such segments as hee divides by 2 meanes, but these segments are as the cubes of the lines ai, ae whereas the segments of a sphære are not as the cubes of their respective axes. If indeed ake (fig 2) bee a Parabola insisting on the base ae & cut by ik parallely to its axis, the segments of this will be analogous to those of a sphære, but this Lalover divides otherways then by 2 meanes prop 9 lib: 4. I cannot therefore yet bee convinced that anyone problem can be solved both those ways, which if it could, it would bee noe hard matter to take away both the two middle termes wh of any cubick æquation. Which whoever performes I shall esteem as a great Apollo & admire as much as if hee had squared the circle, because I judg both impossible. And my reason is this that æquations to what termes soever they are reduced their reall roots never becom imaginary nor their imaginary roots reall (though indeed their true roots may become false & false ones true). But could a cubick æquation which hath 3 reall roots (and consequently is solvible by trisection) have its two middle termes taken away (& consequently become soluble by 3 meanes) two of its reall roots must bee transformed into imaginary ones, for all simple cubick æquations can have but one root reall & two imaginary. I thank you for your intimation about the limits of æquations, & differencing their homogeneall termes, but though the speculation bee pritty I much suspect it will never becom usefull for the solving of æquations. If I chance to meet with any thing that may improve it you shall have notice thereof. Upon the receipt of your last letter I sometimes thought to have set upon writing a compleate introduction to Algebra, being cheifely moved to it by this that some thingls I had inserted into Kinck-Huysen were not so congruous as I could have wished to his manner of writing. Thus having composed somthing pretty largely about reducing æqu problems to an æquation when I came to consider his examples (which make the 4th part of his booke) I found most of them solved not by any generall Analyticall method but by particular & contingent inventions, which though many times more concise then a generall method would allow, yet in my judgment are lesse propper to instruct a learner; as Acrostick's & such kind of artificiall Poetry though never soe excellent would bee but impropper examples to instruct one that aimes at Ovidian Poetry. But considering that by reason of severall divertisements I should bee so long in doing it as to tire you patience with expectation, & also that there being severall Inctroductions to Algebra already published I might thereby gain the esteeme of one ambitious among the croud ambitious to have my scribbles printed, I have chosen rather to let it passe without much altering what I sent you before. Yet because you seeme to bee most sollicitous about the doctrine of surds delivered in it, I desire that when your leisure will permit you to write you would intimate wherein the particulars in which you think it most defective. For at my reveiwing the papers, I judged it not so imperfect as I thought it had beene when I sent for them back againe & soe have hitherto added two or three examples onely more then was done before. I have sent back your Humes, Van Ceulen, Fergusons Labyrinthus Algebræ both parts of it, & Kinck-Huysen on the Conic-sections. But his Algebra I presume to keepe by me till you have occasion for it. So thanking you for the said Books, with other favours & desiring to bee excused for troubling you thus amongst the midst of your buisinesse I rest Your humble Servitor Is: Newton Mr Newton a Sphere and a Parabola not divided in ratione data by meane Proportionalls These To Mr John Collins at his house the next doore to the Crowne in Bloomsbury in London. with a Packet.",NATP00233,1670-09-27 00:00:00

Sir The book which my Carrier by forgetfulnesse disappointed me of the last week I have now received & thank you for it. With the Telescope which I made I have sometimes seen remote objects & particularly the Moon very distinct in those parts of it which were neare the sides of the visible angle. And at other times when it hath been otherwise put together it hath exhibited things not without some confusion. which difference I attributed chiefely to some imperfection that might possibly be either in the figures of the metalls or eye glasse, & once I found it caused by a little tarnishing of the Metall in 4 or 5 days of moist weather. One of the Fellows of our College is making such such another Telescope with which last night I looked on Jupiter & he seemed as distinct & sharply defined as I have seen him in other Telescopes. When he hath finished it I will examin more strictly & send you an account of its f performances, For it seemes to be somthing better then that which I made. Your humble servant I.

Read Mar: 21: 71 Enter'd LB. 5. 364. Sir In my last letter I gave you occasion to suspect that the instrument which I sent you is in some respect or other indisposed, or that the metalls are tarnished. And by your letter March 16 I am fully confirmed in that opinion. For whilest I had it, it magnified represented the Moon in some parts of it as distinctly as other Telescopes usually doe which magnify as much as that. Yet I very well know that that instrument hath its imperfections both in the composition of the metall & in its being badly cast as you may perceive by a scabrous place nereneare the middle of the middetale of the metallon the polished side, & also in the figurede of that metall neare that scabrous place. And in all those respects that instrument is capable of further improvement. You seem to intimate that the proportion of 38 to 1 holds holds onely for its magnifying objects at small distances. But if for such distances suppose 500 foot it magnify at that rate, by the rules of opticks it must for the greatest distance imaginable magnify more then 3734 to 1 which is so insensible a diminishing that I it may be even then put as 38 to 1. I told you that here is another instrument made like the former which doth very well. Yesterday I compared it with a six foot Telescope & found it not onely to magnify more but also more distinctly. And to day I found that at a hundred foot distance I could reade in one of the Philosophicall Transactions placed in the sun's light at a hundred foot distance, & that at a hundred & twenty foot distance I could discern some of the words. When I made this tryall its aperture (defined next the eye) was equalentequivalent to more then an inch and a third part of the object metall. This I thought good to inform you of because it may be of some use to those that shall endeavour any thing in reflectxions. For hereby they will in some measure be enabled to judg of the goodness of their instruments. &And for this end you may annex these observations made with this last instrument, to the description of it in the Transactions of this Month. But my answer to Mr Hooks observations will not be ready for then, because I intend to annex to that answer some further explications of the Theory, which I shall not have leisure to do this week or fourtnight.

Any musicall progression ab.ab+c. ab+2⁢c.ab+3⁢c.ab+4⁢c &c being propounded whose last terme is ad: for the following operation choose any convenient number e (whither whole broken or surd) which intercedes these limits 2⁢m⁢nb+d & m⁢n; supposing b−12⁢c to bee m, & d+12⁢c to bee n. And this proportion will give you the aggregate of the termes very neareby the truth. As the Logarithm e+12⁢ce−12⁢c to the Logarithm of nm, so is ae to the desired summe. Example. Suppose the progression bee 1005.1006.1007.1008.1009.10010. That is a=100. b=5. c=1. d=10. m=4,5. n=10,5. 2⁢m⁢nb+d=6,3. m⁢n=6,9, & e=6,6 the number equally interceding those limits 6,3 & 6,9. And the operation will bee as follows. e+12⁢ce−12⁢c=7,16,1; its Log: is0,065929. & the Log: of that Logarithm is4,819076 0nm=10,54,5; its Log: is0,367976. &yeLog: ofytLogarithm is5,565819 0ae=1006,6; its Logarithm is __________________________________________1,180456 ___________ And hence the fourth proportionall its Logarithm is1,927199which indicates 84,566 to bee the desired aggregate. The same by adding the severall termes together will bee found more justly to bee 84,5636 . But note that if there were more termes inserted into the progression, (as suppose it was 1005.100512.1006.100612.1007 &c) the rule would still more approach to truth. And so it will in the examples of usury 100106.100112.100118.100124 &c or 100108.100116.100124.100132 &c. Or in any other where the difference of the denominators beares a lesse proportion to the denominator of the first terme. The ground of this rule I beleive you will easily apprehend by contemplating the Hyperbola, what relation its area beares to such a musicall progressions. Farewell Your much obliged Servitorur I.

Sir At the reading of your letter I was surprised to see so much care taken about securing an invention to mee, of which I have hitherto had so little value. And therefore since the Royal Society is pleased to think it worth the patronizing, I must acknowledg it deserves much more of them for that, then of mee, who, had not the communication of it been desired, might have let it still remained in private as it hath already done some yeares. —[The description of the instrument you sent mee is very well, onely the radius of the concave metall which you put 14inches is more justly 1223 or 13inches, & the radius of the eye glasse which you put half an inch is the twelft part of it, if not lesse. For the metall collects the suns rays at 613inches distance, & the distance of eye glass at lesse then 16t part of an inch distance from its vertex. By the tooles also to which they were ground I know their dimensions, & particularly measuring the diameter of the diameter of the hemisphæricall concave in which the eye glasse was ground I find it the 6t part of an inch. Perhaps it may give some satisfaction to Mounsieur Hugens to understand in what degree it represents things distinct & free from colours, & to know the aperture by which it admits light. And after the words [— versus focum E reflectatur.] it may not bee amiss to add this note Conferendo distantias foci istius a verticibus Lentis et speculi concavi, hoc est EF16dig et ETU613dig, prodit ratio 1 ad 38, qua indicatur objecta 38 vicibus circiter ampliari. And to this proportion is very consentaneous the observation of the crowns on the weathercock. For the scheme represents it bigger by 212 times when seene through this, then when through an ordinary perspective. And so supposing that to magnify 13 or 14 times, as by the description it should, this by the experiment proportionably must magnify almost as much as I have assigned it. — To the objection that with it objects are difficultly found, I may answer that that's the inconvenience of all Tubes that magnify much, & that after a little use the inconvenience will grow lesse, For I could readily enough find any day objects by knowing which way they were posited from other objects that I accidentally saw in it; but in the night to find starrs I confesse is troublesom enough. Yet this may bee easily remedyed by two sights affixed to the iron rodd by which the tube is susteined. And such I once intended should have beene made before I sent it away from mee, but that I thought the defect would not bee judged materiall. If such sights bee not found a sufficient remedy, there may bee an ordinary perspective glasse fastened to the same frame with the tube, & directed towards the same object, as DesCartes in his Dioptricks hath described for remedying the same inconvenience of his best telescopes. The plane side of the eye glasse is apt to bee soiled with dust falling upon it. And therefore the little leaden ring put into the orifice of the bigger leaden barrell to moderate its aperture must bee sometimes taken out, & the glass wiped with leather done upon the small end of a stick, or other such like contrivance, but care must bee taken that the said ring bee not lost, for without it objects appeare very confused at the edges of the apparent space. So if the concave metall contract any dullnesse by moysture or otherwise, it ought to bee taken out and rubbed with gentle leather, but not with putty or any thing that may weare the metall. I am very sensible of the honour done me by the Bishop of Sarum in proposing mee Candidate & which I hope will bee further conferred upon mee by my Election into the Society. And if so, I shall endeavour to testify my gratitude by communicating what my poore & solitary endeavours can effect towards the promoting your Philosophicall designes.

Philosophical Transactions No. 81. p. 4006. that some of the Fellows of the Honourable Society in ortder to a bigger reflective Telescope are devising a fit Metalline matter, let me presume to give them this caution that whilst they seek for a white hard & durable metalline composition they resolve not upon such an one as is full of small pores onely discoverable by a Microscope. For though such an one may to appearance take a good polish, yet the edges of those small pores will weare away faster in the polishing then the other parts of the Metall, & so however the Metall seem polite yet it shall not reflect with such an accurate regularity as it ought to doe. Thus Tin-glasse mixt with ordinary Bell-metall makes it more white & apt to reflect a greater quantity of light; but with all its fumes raised in the fusion like so many aeriall bubbles fill the Metall full of those Microscopicall pores. But white Arsenick both blanches the Metall & leaves it solid without any such pores, especially if the fusion hath not been too violent. What the stellate Regulus of Mars (which I have sometimes used) or other such like substance will doe, deserves particular examination. Let mee add this further intimation that Putty or other such like pouder with which tis polished, by the sharp angles of its particles fretteth the metall if it bee not very fine & filleth it full of such small holes as I speak of. And therefore care must be taken of that, before judgment bee given whether the metall bee throughout the body of it porous or not. I desire that in your next letter you would inform mee for what time the Society continue their weekely meetings, because if they continue them for any time I am purposing them, to be considered of & examined, an accompt of a Philosophicall discovery which induced mee to the making of the said Telescope, & which I doubt not but will prove much more gratefull then the communication of that instrument, being in my Judgment the oddest if not the most considerable detection which hath hitherto beene made in the operations of Nature.

Sir, After I haue thanked you for your answer to my Quære about Cyder, which liquor I wish, with you, propagated far and near in England; I think myself obliged to impart to you a piece of a letter, I lately receiued from Monsieur Hugenius which concerns your doctrine of Light, which he, like Mr Hook, calls an Hypothesis , or an opinion, notwithstanding your printed defence against that Appellation. I'll giue you his discours in his own language, as followeth; I'ay vû, comme Mr Newton prend penie à Soutenir sa nouuelle Opinion touchant les couleurs. Il me semble, que la plus importante Objection, qu'on luy fait en forme de Quære, est celle S'il y a plus de deux sortes de couleurs? Car pour moy ie crois, qu'une Hypothese, qui expliqueroit mechaniquement et part la nature du mouvement la couleur Iaune et la Bleuë, suffiroit pour toutes les autres, par ce que celles-cy, estant seulement plus chargees (come il paroit par les prismes de M. Hook) produisent le rouge et le bleu obscur, et que de ces quatre tout le reste des couleurs se peut composer. Ie ne vois pas aussi, pourquoy Mr Newton ne se contente pas des 2 couleurs, Iaune et Bleu. Car il sera bien plus aisé de trouver vne hypothese par le mouvement, qui expliquât ces deux differences, que non pas pour tant de diversitez qu'il y a d'autres couleurs. Et iusques à ce qu'il ait trouvé cete hypothese, il ne nous aura pas appris, ex quoy consiste la nature et difference des couleurs, mais seulement cet accident (qui assurement est fort considerable) de leur differente refrangibilité. Pour ce qui est de l'autre, asscauoir la Composition du Blanc de toutes les Couleurs ensemble, il se pourroit faire, que le Iaune et le Bleu seroient encor suffisans pour cela: ce qui vaut la peine d'estre essayé, et il il se peut par l'Experience que Mr Newton propose, de receuoir contre la muraille d'une chambre obscure les couleurs du Prisme, et d'esclairaer par leur lumiere refleschie vn papier blanc. Il faudroit empescher les couleurs des extremitez, scavoir le Rouge et le Pourpre, de donner contre la muraille, et laissez seulement les couleurs d'entredeux le Iaune, verd et Bleu, pour voir, Si la lumiere de celles-cy seules ne feroit pas paroitre Blanc le papier, aussi bien que quand elles esclairent toutes. Ie doubte mesme, si l'endroit le plus clair du Iaune ne feroit pas tout seul cet effet; et ie l'essaieray a la premiere commodité. vous voiez bien cependant, qua, si ces Experiences succedent, l'on ne pourra plus dire, que toutes les couleurs sont necessaires pour composer le Blanc, et qu'il sera tres-vraysemblable, que toutes les autres ne sont que des degrez du Iaune et Bleu, plus ou moins enfoncez. Au reste, pour ce qui est de l'effet des differentes Refractions des rayons dans les Verres de Lunette, il est certain, que l'Experience ne s'accorde pas auec ce que tient Mr Newton; car, à considerer seulement la peniture, que fait vn Objectif de 12. pieds dans vne chambre obscure, l'on voit qu'elle est trop distincte et trop bien terminee pour pouvoir estre produite par des rayson, qui s'escar, teroient dela 50me partie de l'ouverture: De sonte que la difference dela Refrangibilité ne suit pas peut estre tousiours la mesme proportion dans les grandes et petites inclinations des rayons sur les surfaces du verre. Sr, I haue transcribed this at large as I receiued it, leauing it to be consider'd by you at leisure, and not doubting but you will giue satisfaction to M. Hugens by the hands of your faithful friend and humble servant Oldenburg. P.S.

Not having tryed many proportions of the Arsenick & Metall I am not assured which is absolutely best, but there may conveniently be used any quantity of Arsenick equalling in weight between a sixt & eight part of the Copper. A greater proportion makes the metall brittle. The way which I used it is this. I first melted the Copper alone, then put in the Arsenick, which being melted I stirred them a little together, bewaring in the meane time that I drew not in breath neare the pernicious fumes. After that I put in the Tin, & again, so soon as that was melted, which was very suddenly, I stirred them well together, & immediately powered them of. I know not whether by letting them stand longer on the fire after the Tin was melted, a higher degree of fusion would have made the metall porous, but I thought that way I proceeded to bee safest. In that metall which I sent to London there was noe Arsenick, but a small proportion of silver: as I remember 1s in ℥iij of metall. But I thought the silver did as much harm in making the metall soft & so lesse fit to bee polished, as good in rendering it white & luminous. At another time I mixed Arsenick ℥j Copper ℥vj & Tin ℥ij.

153,Isaac Newton,Science,Draft of 'A Theory Concerning Light and Colors',"MS Add. 3970.3, ff.460-466",6 Feb. 1671/2,England,"['English', 'Latin']","3970 (B) Trin: Coll Cambridge. Feb. 6. 16712 Sir To perform my late promise to you, I shall without further ceremony acquaint you, that in the beginning of the year 1666 (at which time I applyed my self to the grinding of Optick glasses of other figures then Sphericall) I procured me a triangular glasse Prisme to try therewith the celebrated phænomena of colours. And in order thereto having darkned my chamber & made a small hole in my window-shuts to let in a convenient quantity of the sun's light, I placed my Prism at its entrance that it might be thereby refracted to the opposite wall. It was at first a very pleasing divertisement to view the vivid & intense colours produced thereby; but after a while applying my selfe to consider them more circumspectly, I became surprized to see them in an oblong form, which according to the received lawes of refraction I expected should have been circular. They were terminated at the sides with streight lines, but at the ends the decay of light was so graduall that it was difficult to determine justly what was their figure, yet they seemed semicircular. Comparing the length of this Coloured Spectrum with its bredth I found it about five times greater, a disproportion soe extravagant that it excited me to a more then ordinary curiosity of examining frōom whence it might proceed; I could scarce think that the various thicknesse of the glasse, or the termination with shaddow or darknesse could have any influence on light to produce such an effect, yet I thought it not amis amisse to examine first those circumstances, & soe tryed what would happen by transmitting light through parts of the glasse of divers thicknesses, or through holes in the window of divers bignesses, or by setting the Prism without, so that the light might passe through it & bee refracted before it was terminated by the hole: but I found none of those circumstances materiall. The fashion of the colours was in all these cases the same. Then I suspected whither by any unnevenesse in the glass or other contingent irregularity these colours might be thus dilated. And to try this I took another prism like the former & soe placed it that the light passing through them both might be refracted contrary wayes & so by the latter returned into that course frōom which the former had diverted it. ffor by this meanes I thought the regular effects of the first Prism would be destroyed by the sceond Prism, but the irregular ones more augmented by the multiplicity of refractions. The event was that the light which by the first Prism was diffused into an oblong form was by the second reduced into an orbicular one with as much regularity as when it did not at all passe through them. So that what ever was the cause of that length 'twas not any contingent irregularity. I then proceded to examine more critically what might be effected by the difference of the incidence of rayes com̄mming frōom divers parts of the Sun, & to that end measured the severall lines & angles belonging to the image. Its distance frōom the hole or Prism was 22 foot, its utmost length 1314 inches, its breadth 258 inches, the diameter of the hole 14 of an inch, the angle which the rayes tending towards the midle of the image made with those lines in which they would have proceeded without refraction 44 degr. 56'. And the verticall angle of the Prism 63 degr 12'. Also the refractions on both sides the Prism, that is of the incident & emergent rayes were as near as I could make them, equall, & consequently about 54 degr 4'. And the rayes fell perpendicularly upon the wall. Now subducting the diameter of the hole frōom the length & breadth of the image there remains 13 inches the length & 238 the breadth comprehended by those rayes which passed through the center of the said hole & consequently the angle at the hole which that breadth subtended was about 31' answerable to the sun's diameter, but the angle which its length subtended was more then five such diameters, namely 2 degr 49'. Having made these observations I first computed from them the refractive power of that glasse & found it measured by the ratio of the sines 20 to 31. And then by that ratio I computed the refractions of two rayes flowing frōom opposite parts of the sun's discus, so as to differ 31' in their obliquity of incidence, & found that the emergent rayes should have comprehended an angle of about 31' as they did before they were incident. But because this computation was founded on the Hypothesis of the proportionality of the Sines of incidence & refraction, which, though by my own & others experience, I could not imagine to be so erroneous as to make that angle but 31' which in reality was 2 degr 49' yet my curiosity caused me again to take my Prism. And having placed it at my window as before I observed that by turning it a little about its axis to & fro, so as to vary its obliquity to the light more then by an angle of 4 or 5 degrees, the colours were not thereby sensibly translated from their place on the wall, & consequently by that variation of incidence, the quantity of refraction was not sensibly varied. By this experiment461 By this experiment therefore as well as by the former computation it was evident that the difference of the incidence of rayes flowing from divers parts of the Sun, could not make them after decussation diverge at a sensibly greater angle then that at which they before converged. which being at most but about 31. or 32 minutes, there still remained some other cause to be found out frōom whence it could be 2 degr 49'. Then I began to suspect whither the rayes after their trajection through the Prism did not move in curve lines & acording to their more or lesse curvity tend to divers parts of the wall. And it increased my suspiciton when I remembred that I had often seen a Tennis-ball struck with an oblique Racket describe such a curve line. for a circular as well as a progressive motion being communicated to it by that stroak, its parts on that side where the motions conspire must presse & beat the contiguous air more violently then on the other, & there excite a reluctancy & reaction of the air proportionally greater. And for the same reason, if the rayes of light should possibly bee globular bodyes & by their oblique passage out of one medium into another acquire a circulating motion, they ought to feel the greater resistance from the ambient Æther on that side where the motions conspire & thence be continually bowed to the other. But notwithstanding this plausible ground of suspicion when I came to examine it I could observe noe such curvity in them. And besides (which was enough for my purpose) I observed that the difference betwixt the length of the image & diameter of the hole through which the light was transmitted, was proportionable to their distance. The graduall removall of these suspicions at length led me to the experimentum crucis; which was this. I took two boards, & placed one of them close behind the Prism at the window, so that the light might passe through a small hole made in it for that purpose & fall on the other board which I placed at about twelve foot distance, having first made a small hole in it also for some of that incident light to passe through. Then I placed another Prism behind this second board so that the light trajected through both the boards might passe through that also & & be again refracted before it arrived at the wall. This done, I took the first Prism in my hand & turned it to & fro slowly about its axis so much as to make the severall parts of the image cast on the second board, successively passe through the hole in it, that I might observe to what places on the wall the second Prism would refract them. And I saw by the variation of those places, that the light tending to that end of the image towards which the refraction of the first Prism was made, did in the second Prism suffer a refraction considerably greater then the light tending to the other end. And soe the true cause of the length of that image was detected to be noe other then that light consists of rayes differently refrangible which without any respect to a difference in their incidence were according to their degrees of refrangibility transmitted towards diverse parts of the wall. When I understood this, I left of my aforesaid glassworkes, for I saw that the perfection of Telescopes was hitherto limited, not so much for want of glasses truly figured according to the prescriptions of Optick writers Authors, which all men have hitherto imagined, as because that light it selfe is a heterogeneous mixture of differently refrangible rayes. So that were a Glasse so exactly figured as to collect any one sort of rayes into one point, it could not collect those also into the same point which having the same incidence upon the same medium are apt to suffer a different refraction. Nay I wondered that seing the differentce of refrangibility was soe great as I found it, Telescopes should arrive to that perfection thay are now at. ffor measuring the refractions in one of my Prisms I found that supposing the cōommon sine of incidence upon onone of its planes was 44 parts, the sine of refraction of the utmost rayes on the red end of the colours made out of the glasse into the air would be 68 parts, & the sine of refraction of the utmost ray rayes on the other end 69 parts. So that the difference is about a 24th or 25t part of the whole refraction. And consequently the objectglasse of any Telescope cannot collect all the rayes which come frōom one point of an object, so as to make them convene at its focus in lesse room then in a circular space whose diameter is the 50th part of the diameter of its spectrum. which is an irregularity462 which is an irregularity some hundreds of times greater then a circularly figured lens, of so small a section as the objectglasses of long Telescopes are, would cause by the unfitnesse of its figure, were light uniform. This made me take reflections into consideration; & finding them regular, so that the angle of reflection of all sorts of rayes was equall to their angle of incidence I understood that by their mediation Optick instruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable if provided a reflecting substance could be found which would polish as finely as glasse, & reflect as much light as glasse transmitts, & the art of com̄mmunicating to it a Parabolick figure bee also attained. But those seemed very great difficulties, & I almost thought them insuperable when I further considered that every irregularity in a reflecting superficies makes the rayes stray 5 or 6 times more out of their due course then the like irregularities in a refracting one. So that a much greater curiosity would be here requisite then in figuring glasses for refraction. Amidst these thoughts I was forced frōom Cambridge by the intervening Plague & it was more then two years before I proceeded further. But then having thought on a tender way of polishing propper for mettall, & wherby as I imagined the figure also would be corrected to the last, I began to try what might be effected in this kind, & by degrees so far perfected an instrument (in the essential parts of it like that I sent to London) by which I could discern Iupiters four concomitants, & showed them divers times to two others of my acquaintance. I could also discern the moon-like phase of Venus, but not very distinctly nor without some nicenesse in disposing the instrument. ffrom that time I was interrupted till this last Autumn, when I made the other. And as that was sensibly better then the first, (especially for day Objects) so I doubt not but they will be still brought to a much greater perfection by their endeavours who as you inform me are taking care about it at London. I have sometimes thought to make a microscope which in like manner should have instead of an objectglasse a relecting piece of metall. And this I hope they will also take into consideration for those For those instruments seem as capable of improvement as Telescopes, & perhaps more because but one reflective peice of metall is requisite in them, as you may perceive by the annexed diagram where A B representeth the object metall, C D the eyeglasse, F their cōommon focus, & O the other focus of the metall in which the object is placed. But to return frōom this digression, I told you that light is not similar or homogeneall but consists of difform rayes, some of which are more refrangible then others. So that of those which are alike incident on the same medium, some shall be more refracted then others, & that not by any virtue of the glasse or other externall cause, but from a predisposition which every particular ray hath to suffer a particular degree of refraction. I shall now proceed to acquaint you with another more notable difformity in its rayes wherin the origen of colours is infolded. A naturalist would scarce beleive expect to see the science of those become mathematicall, & yet I dare affirm that there is as much certainty in it as in any other part of Opticks. ffor what I shall tell concerning them is not an Hypothesis but most rigid consequence, not conjectured by barely inferring 'tis thus because not otherwise or because it satisfies all phænomena (the Philosophers universall Topick,) but evinced by the mediation of experiments concluding directly & without any suspicion of doubt. To continue the historicall narration of these experiments would make a discourse too tedious & confused, & therefore I shall rather lay down the doctrine first, & then for its examination give you an instance or two of the experiments as a Specimen of the rest. The Doctrine you will find comprehended & illustrated in the following propositions. 1. As the rayes of light differ in degrees of refrangibility, so they also differ in their disposition to exhibit this or that particular colour. Colours are not qualifications of light derived frōom refractions or reflections of naturall bodies as 'tis generally beleived, but originall & connate properties, which in diverse rayes are divers, some rayes are disposed to exhibit a red colour & noe other, some a463 some a yellow & noe other, some a green & noe other & so of the rest. Nor are there only rayes propper & peculiar to the more eminent colours, but even to all their intermediate gradations. 2. To the same degree of refrangibility ever belongs the same colour, & to the same colour ever belongs the same degree of refrangibility. The least-refrangible rayes are all disposed to exhibit a red colour & contrarily those rayes which are disposed to exhibit a red colour are all the least refrangible. So the most refrangible rayes are all disposed to exhibit a deep violett colour & contrarily those which are apt to exhibit such a violet colour are all the most refrangible. And so to all the intermediate colours in a continued series belong intermediate degrees of refrangibility. And this Analogy 'twixt colours & refrangibility is very precise & strict: the rayes always either exactly agreeing in both or proportionally disagreeing in both. 3. The Species of colour & degree of refrangibility propper to any particular sort of rayes, is not mutable by refraction, nor by reflection frōom naturall bodies, nor by any other cause that I could yet observe. When any one sort of rayes hath been well parted frōom those of other kinds it hath afterwards obstinately retained its colour notwithstanding my utmost endeavours to chang it. I have refracted it with Prismes, & reflected it with bodies which in day light were of other colours; I have intercepted it with the coloured film of air interceding two compressed plates of Glasse, transmitted it through coloured mediums & through mediums irradiated with other sort of rayes, & diversly terminated it, & yet could not produce any new colour out of it. It would by contracting or dilating become more brisk or faint, & by the losse of many rayes in some cases very obscure & dark, but I could never see it changed in Specie. 4 Yet seeming transmutations of colours may be made where there is any mixture of divers sorts of rayes: ffor in such mixtures the component colours appear not, but by their mutuall allaying each other constitute a midling colour. And therefore if by refraction or or any other of the aforesaid causes the difform rayes latent in such a mixture bee seperated, there shall emerge colours different frōom the colour of the composition. Which colours are not new generated but only made apparent by being parted. ffor if they be again intirely mixed & blended together, they will again compose that colour which they did before seperation. And for the same reason transmutations made by the convening of divers colours are not reall; for when the difform rayes are again severed they will exhibit the very same colours which they did before they entered the composition. As you see blew & yellow powders when finely mixed appear to the naked eye green & yet the colours of the component corpuscles are not thereby really transmuted, but only blended. ffor when veiwed with a good Microscope they still appear blew & yellow interspersedly. 5 There are therefore two sorts of colours. The one originall & simple; the other compounded of these. The originall or primary colours are Red, yellow, Green, Blew, & a violet purple; together with Orang, Indico, & an indefinite varietie of intemediate gradations. 6 The same colours in Specie with these primary ones may be also produced by composition: ffor a mixture of yellow & blew makes green, of red & yellow makes Orang of Orang & yellowish green makes yellow. And in generall if any two colours be mixed, which in the series of those generated by the Prism are not too far distant one from another, they by their mutuall alloy compound that colour which in the said series appeareth in the midway between them. But those which are situated at too great a distance doe not soe. Orang & Indico produce not the intermediate green, nor Scarlet & green the intermediate yellow. 7 But the most surprizing & wonderfull composition was that of whitenesse. There is noe one sort of rayes which alone can exhibit this. Tis ever compounded & to its composition are requisite all the aforesaid primary colours mixed in a due proportion. I have often with admiration beheld that all the colours of the Prism being made 464 made to converge & thereby to be again mixed as they were in the light before it was incident upon the Prism, reproduced light intirely & perfectly white, & not at all sensibly differing from the direct light of the sun; unlesse when the glasses I used were not sufficiently clear, for then they would a little tinge incline it with to their colour. 8. Hence therefore it comes to passe that whitenesse is the usuall colour of light: ffor light is a confused agregate of rayes indued with all sorts of colours as they are promiscuously darted from the various parts of luminous bodies. And of such a confused agregate as I said is generated whitenesse if there be a due proportion of the ingredients; But if any one predominate, the light must incline to that colour as it happens in the blew flame of Brimstone, the yellow flame of a candle & the various colours of the fixt starrs. 9. These thinges considered, the manner how colours are produced by the Prism is evident. ffor of the rayes constituting the incident light since those which differ in colour proportionally differ in refrangibility, they by their unequall refractions must be severed & dispersed into an oblong form in an orderly succession frōom the least refracted scarlet to the most refracted violedt. And for the same reason it is that objects when looked upon through a Prism appear coloured. ffor the difform rayes by their unequall refractions are made to diverge toward severall parts of the Retina & there expresse the images of thinges coloured as in the former case they did the sun's image upon a wall. And by this inequality of refractions they become not only coloured but also very confused & indistinct. 10 Why the colours of the rainbow appear in falling drops of rain is also frōom hence evident. ffor those drops which refract the rayes disposed to appear purple in greatest quantity to the Spectators eye, refract the rayes of other sorts soe much lesse as to make them passe beside it; & such are the dropes in the inside of the primary Bow & on the outside of the second or exterior one. So those drops which refract in greatest plenty the rayes apt to appear red toward the Spectators eye, refract those of other sorts soe much more as to make them passe beside it, & such are the drops on the exterior part of the Primary & interior part of the secondary Bow. 11. The odd Phænomenona of an infusion of Lignum Nephriticum, leaf-Gold, fragments of coloured glasse, & some other transparently coloured bodies appearing in one position of one colour, & of another in another are on these grounds noe longer riddles. ffor those are substances apt to reflect one sort of light & transmit another; as may be seen in a dark Room by illustratingminating them with similar or uncompounded light. ffor then they appear of that colour only with which they are illuminated, but yet in one position more vivid & luminous then in another, accordingly as they are disposed more or lesse to reflect or transmit the incident colour. 12 ffrom hence also is manifest the reason of an unexpected experiment which Mr Hook somewhere in his Micrographia relates to have made with two wWedg-like transparent vessells filled the one with a red, the other with a blew liquor: Namely that though they were severally transparent enough yet both together became opake. ffor if one transmitted only red & the other only blew, no rayes could passe through both. 13 I might add more instances of this nature, but I shall conclude with this generall one, that the colours of all naturall bodies have noe other origin then theis, that they are variously qualified to reflect one sort of light in greater plenty then another. And this I have experimented in a dark Room by illuminating those bodies with uncompounded light of divers colours. ffor by that means any bodie may be made to appear of any colour. They have there noe appropriate colour but ever appear of the colour cast upon them, but yet with this difference that they are most brisk & vivid in the light of their own day-light-colour. Minium appeareth there of any colour465 colour indifferently with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in red; & so Bise appeareth indifferently of any colour with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in blew. And therefore Minium reflecteth rayes of any colour, but most copiously those endowed with red; & consequently when illustrated with day-light, that is with all sorts of rayes promiscuously blended, those qualified with red shall abound most in the reflected light, & by their prevalence cause it to appear of that colour. And for the same reason Bise reflecting blew most copiously, shall appear blew by the excesse of those rayes in its reflected light; & the like of other bodies. And that this is the intire & adequate cause of their colours is manifest, because they have noe power to change or alter the colour of any sort of rays incident apart, but put on all colours indifferently with which they are enlightened. These thinges being so, it can be no longer disputed whither there be colours in the dark, nor whither thesey be the qualityes of the objects wee see, no nor perhaps whether light be a bodie. ffor since colours are qualityes of light, having its rayes for their entire & imediate subject, how can wee think those rayes qualityes also, unlesse one quality may be the subject of & sustain another, which in effect is to call it substance. Wee should not know bodies for substances were it not for their sensible qualityes, & the principall of themose being now found due to something else, wee have as good reason to beleive that to be a substance also. Besides who ever thought any quality to be a heterogeneous agregate such as light is discovered to be. But to say determine more absolutely what light is, after what manner refracted, & by what modes or actions it produceth in our minds the Phantasms of colours, is not so easie. . And I shall not mingle conjectures with certaintyes. Reviewing what I have written, I see the discours it selfe will lead to divers experiments sufficient for for its examination: And therefore I shall not trouble you farther then to describe one of those which I have already insinuated. In a darkned Room make a hole in the shutt of a window, whose diameter may conveniently be about a third part of an inch, to admitt a convenient quantity of the Sun's rayes light. And then place a clear & colourlesse Prism to refract the entering light towards the further part of the Room: which as I said will thereby be diffused into an oblong coloured image. Then place a lens of about three foot radius (suppose a broad object-glasse of a three foot Telescope) at the distance of about 4 or 5 foot frōom thence, through which all those colours may at once be transmitted, & made by its refraction to convene at a further distance of about 10 or 12 foot. If at that distance you intercept this light with a sheet of white paper, you will see the colours converted into whitenesse again by being mingled. But it is requisite that the Prism & lens be placed steddy, & that the paper on which the colours are cast bee moved to & fro; for by such motion you will not only find at what distance the whitenesse is most perfect, but also see how the colours gradually convene & vanish into whitenesse, & afterwards having crossed one another in that place where they compound whitenesse, are again dissipated & severed & in an inverted order retain the same colours which they had before they entered the composition. You may also see that if any of the colours at the lens be intercepted, the whitenesse will be changed into the other colours. And therefore that the composition of whitenesse be perfect, care must be taken that none of the colours fall beside the lens.466 In the annexed designe of this experiment A B C representeth the Prism set endwise to sight, close by the hole F of the window E G. Its vertical angle A C B may conveniently be about 60 degrees. M N designes the lens. Its breadth 212 or 3 inches. S F one of the streight lines in which difform rayes may be conceived to flow successively from the Sun. F P & F R two of those rayes unequally refracted, which the Lens makes to converg towards Q, & after decussation to diverge again. And H I the paper at divers distances on which the colours are projected: which in Q constitute whitenesse, but are red & yellow in R, r, & ρ; & blew & purple in P, p & π. If you proceed further to try the impossibility of changing any uncompounded colour, which I have asserted in the 3d and 13th propositions; 'tis requisite that the Room be made very dark, least any scattering light mixing with the colour, disturb & allay it & render it compound, contrary to the design of the experiment 'Tis also requisite that there be a perfecter seperation of the colours then after the manner above described can be made by the refraction of one single Prism; & how to make such further seperations will scarce be difficult to them that consider the discovered lawes of refractions. But if tryall shall be made with colours not throughly seperated there must be allowed changes proportionable to the mixture. Thus if compound yellow light fall upon blew bBise, the Bise will not appear perfectly yellow, but rather green, because there are in the yellow mixture many rayes indued with green, because there are in the yellow & green being lesse remote frōom the usuall blew colour of Bise then yellow, is more copiously reflected by it. In like manner if any of the Prismatick colours, suppose Red, be intercepted on design to try the asserted impossibility of reproducing that colour out of the others which are pretermitted 'tis necessary either that the colours be very well parted before the red be intercepted, or that together with the red the neighbouring colours into which any red is secretly dispersed (that is the yellow & perhaps green too) bee intercepted, or else that allowance be made for the emerging of so much red out of the yellow & green as may possibly have been diffused & scatteringly blended in theose colours. And if these thinges be observed the new production of Red or any intercepted colour will be found impossible. This I conceive is enough for an introduction to experiments of this kind; which if any of the R Society shall be so curious as to prosecute, I should be very glad to be informed with what successe. That if any thing seem to be defective or to thwart this relation, I may have an opportunity of giving further direction inabout it, or iof acknowledging my errors if I have cōommitted any.

9,Isaac Newton,Science,"Copy of a letter to John Collins, dated 9 April 1672",EL/N1/46,9 April 1672,England,"['English', 'French']","4646 By Mr Newton to Mr Collins. By Mr Newtons Answer to Mr Gregories Letter of March: 7: 1673. (Entd LB. 6. 71.) Cambridge Apr. 9. 1673. Sir Having perused Mr Gregorys candid reply, I have thought good to send you these further considerations upon the differences that still are betweene us. And first that a well polish'tet plate reflects at the obliquity of 45 degrees more truly then direct ones seemes to me very certaine, For the flatt tubercula or shallow valleys, such as may be the remaines of scratches almost worne out, will cause the least errors in the obligquest rays which fall on all sides the hill, excepting on the midle of the foreside and backside of it, that is where the hill inclines directly towards or directly from the ray; For if the ray fall on that section of the hill, its error is in all obliquitys just double to the hills declivity: but if it fall on any other part of the hill its error is lesse then double, if it be an oblique ray, and that so much the lesse, by how much the ray is obliquer; but if it be a direct ray, its error is just double to the declivity and therefore greatestrgreatest in that case. I presume Mr. Gregory, if you think it convenient to transmitt this to him, will easily apprehend me. FHorw the charge may bevariedbe varied, at pleasure in my Telescope, will appear by this figure, where A represents the great Concave, E the Eye-Glasse, and BCD a Prisme of Glasse or Crystall whose sides BC & BD are not flat but spherically convex, so that the rays which come from G the focus of the great concave A, may by the refraction of the first side BC be reduced into parallelism, and after reflection from the base CD be made by the refraction of the next side BD to converge to the focus of the Eye-Glass H. The Telescope being thus formed it appears how the charge may be altered by varying the distances of the glasses and speculum. As for the objection that Mr. Gregorys Telescope will be either overcharged or have too small an Angle of vision &c I apprehend that the difference betweene us lyes in limiting the aperture of the Eye-glass. Mr. Gregory puts it equall to that of the little Concave, but I should rather determine it by this proportion; That if a midle point be taken between the Ey-Eye-glass and its focus, the apertures of the Eye-glasse and concave be proportionall to their distances from that point. That is, suppose AB the little concave, EF the eye-glass, GH their common focus or image, and K the meane distance between GH and EF; from the Extremitys of AB draw AK and BK butting on the Eye-Glass at F and E, and EF shall be its aperture. The reason of this limitation is, that the superfluous light, which comes on all sides of the speculum AB to the space GH in which the picture of the object is made, may fall besides the Eye-glass. For if it should passe through it to the Eye-glass, it would exceedingly blend those parts of the picture with which ti's mixed; and such are those parts of it which extend themselves beyond the lines AK, BK. As I remember I said in my former letter that the scattering light which falls on the Eye-glass will disturb the vision; and this is to be understood of any straggling light which comes not from the picture; but if it come from the picture to the Eye-glass, the disturbance will be much greater so as not to be allowed of. Against the first I see no very convenient remedy, & against the last none but assigning a small aperture to the Eye-glasse; supposing the Telescope is used in the day-time or in twy-light, or to view the moon or any starr very near her or near the brighter planets. And if for this reason the aperture be limited by anmmany rule, the Angle of vision will become very small as I limited; affirmed; for instance in that case where Mr. Gregory in his Postscript puts it above 20 degrees, it will be reduced to lesse then halfe a degree. yetYet I confesse there is a way by which the angle of vision may be somthing inlarged, but it will not be very considerably, unless the Eye-glasse be also deeper charged. Why I assign a concave with an Eye-glass to magnifie small objects (in Transact: pag. 3080.) and yet an Eye-glass without such a concave to magnifie the image of the great concave which is equivalent to a small object, is, because that image doth not require to be magnified so much as an object by a microscope, and further because the Angle of the penicill of rays which flow from any point of the small object, that the object may appear sufficiently luminous, ought to be as great as possible; and a concave will with equall distinctnesse reflect the rays at a greater angle of the penicill then in a Lens; but in the Telescope the Angles of those penicills are not so great as to transcend the limits at which an Eye-glasse may with sufficient distinctnesse refract them, and therefore in these Instruments I chose to lay all the stress of magnifying upon the Eye-glasses as it is well capable of, and the excesse only upon the concave. Concerning my citation of Mr. Gregory against Mons Cassegrain the force of it lies only in the inference that Optique instruments most probably according to Mons Cassegrains design had been tryed by reflexion; which I thinke I might well inferr, without haveing regard to the specifick figure of the speculum which Mr. Gregory there spake of. And therefore I think it cannot be said, that I made him speake of spherick figures where his meaning was of hyperbolick and Elliptick ones: but if I should be so understood, because I put the figure of the great concave to be sphericall, wherever I specifie it, I know not why I might not by way of consequence make that interpretation. forFor it is not probable, that any man would attempt Hyperbolick & Elliptick figures of speculums untill the event of sphericall ones had been first tryed. And accordingly the tryall of Mr. Gregory with Mr. Reive was by a sphericall figure. whichWhich trial although I am now satisfyed that it was made very rudely, yet by the information which I had of it when I wrote the letter at large # # about M. Cassegrains designe, I apprehended it to have beene made with great diligence and curiosity, as I signified in my former letter at large. And this I hope may excuse me for speakeing of it in the Transactions as if it had beene tryed with more accuracy then really it was. And thus much concerning the Telescope. The design of the burning speculum appears to me very plausible and worthy of being put in practise: what Artists may thinke of it I know not, but the greatest difficultie in the practise that occurrs to me is to proportion the two surfaces so, that the force of both may be in the same point according to the Theory,. But perhaps it is not necessary to be so curious, for it seems to me that the effect would scarce be sensibly less if both sides should be ground to the concave and gage of the same tool. I suppose you have received a letter from me sent last weeke to signify my receipt of the bookes you sent in Queeres &c. It comes now into my mind that when I sent Mr. Pitts 4łł for Kinkhuysen he further urged a promise of some copies. whenWhen you have opportunity you will oblige me to remember him that his proposall was either 4łł absolutly or 3łł with some copies.

156,Isaac Newton,Science,,"MS Add. 3976, ff. 8r-9v",13 April 1672,England,['English'],"Trin Coll Cambridge, Apr 163 1672. A letter of Mr Newtons, referring to the next next precedent, and giving withall an account of some Experiments, proposed to Mr Newton, for the clearing of his new doctrine of Light. Sir I herewith send you an answer to the Iesuite Pardies considerations,Ph. Tr. N. 83. p. 4059 in the conclusion of which you may possibly apprehend me a little too positive, but I speake onely for my selfe. I am highly sensible of your good will in communicating to me such observations as occur concerning my Theories or Catadioptricall instruments, & I desire you to continue that favour to me. I shall immediately proceed to add what I promised to my answer to Mr Hooks Observations, & then send it you. Monsieur Hugenius has very observed the confusion of refractions neare the edges of a Lens where its two superficies are inclined, much after the same manner as like the planes of Prism whose refractions are in like manner confused. But it is not from the inclination of those superficies so much as from the htereogeneity of light that that confusion is caused. For by illuminating an object with homogeneall light, I have seen it far distincter through a Prism then I could by light that was heterogeneall. I suppose the designe of Sir Robert Morays Experiments is to have their events expressed, with such observations as may occur concerning them. 1. Touching the first I have observed that the solar image falling on a paper placed at the focus of the Lens, was by the interposed Prism drawn out in length proportionall to the Prisms refraction or distance from that focus. And the cheife observable here which I remember was that the streight edges of the oblong image were distincter then they would have been without the lens. Considering that the rays comeing from the Planet Venus are much lesse inclined one to another then those which come from the opposite parts of the suns disque, I once tryed an experiment or two with her light. And to make it sufficiently strong I found it necessary to collect it first by a broade lens, & then interposing a Prism between the Lens & its focus at such distance that all the light might passe through the Prism, I found the focus which before appeared like a lucid point, to be drawn out into a long splendid line by the Prisms refraction. I have sometimes designed to try how a fixt starr seen through a long Telescope would appeare by interposing a Prism between the Telescope & my eye. But by the appearance of Venus viewed with my naked eye through a Prism I presage the event. 2. Concerning the second Experiment I have occasionally observed that by covering both ends of the Prism with paper at severall distances from the middle, the breadth of the solar image will be increadsed or diminished as much as is the aperture of the Prism without any variation of the length. Or if so much & no more augmented. 3. Of the third experiment I have occasion to speake in my answer to Mr Hook, where you will find the effects of two Prisms in all crosse positions of one to another described. But if one Prism alone be turned about, the coloured image will onely be translated from place to places, describing a circle or some other conick section on the wall on which it is projected, without suffering any alteration in its shape, unlesse such as may arrise from the obliquity of the wall, or casuall change of the Prisms obliquity to the sun's rays. 4. The effect of the fourth Experiment I have already insinuated telling you (in pag 3076 of the said Transactions) that light passing through the parts of the Prism of divers thickcnesses did still exhibit the same Phænomena. ITm The long axes of the two Prisms in the experiment described in the said pag 3076 of the Transactions were parallel one to another. And for the rest of their position you will best apprehend it by this scheme, where let EG designe the window, F the hole in it through which the light arrives at the Prisms, ABC the first Prism which refracts the light towards PT, painting there the colours in an oblong forme, & αβγ the second Prism which refracts back againe the rays to Q, where the long image PT is contracted into a round one. The plane αγ to BC, & βγ to AC I suppose parallell, that the rays may be equally refracted contrary ways in both Prisms,. And the Prisms must be placed very neare to one another. For if their deistance be so great that colours begin to appeare in the light before its incidence on the second Prism, those colours will not be destroyed by the contrary refractions of that Prism. These things being observed the round image Q will appeare of the same beignesse which it doth when both the Prisms are taken away that the light may passe directly towards Q from the hole without any refraction at all. And its diameter will equall the diameter breadth of the long image PT if those images be equally distant from the Prisms. If an accurate consideration of these refractions be designed, it is convenient that a Lens be placed in the hole F, or immediately after the Prisms, so that its focus be at the image Q or PT. For thereby the perimeter of the image Q & the streight sides of the image PT will become much better defined then otherwise. Thus far concerning Sir Robert Morays proposalls. I have nothing more at present unlesse to desire you that in the letter wherein I sent you the Table of Apertures & Charges you would change an expressiōon concerning the six foot Tube where I intimated that it was none of the best in its kind. For least the freind of whome it was borrowed should think I depreciate it, I had rather that the expression should be a little extenuated somthing after this manner, that I am not very well assure [9] of its goodnesse & therefore desire that the other experiment of reading at 100 foot distances should rather be confided in. You will do me a favour to peruse the rest of that letter also before you commit it to the presse. For I writ it in so much hast that I had no time to review it. And by rendering any expressions more perspicuous or lesse ambiguous you will still oblige Your Faithfull Servant. I. Newton. I thank you for the kind proffer of these last Transactions. bBut my Carrier was immediately gone towards London before the receipt of your letter.",NATP00390,1672-04-13 00:00:00

Domine Accepi observationes Reverendi Patris Ignatij Pardies in Epistolam meam de lLucis rRefractionibus et cColoribus ad tTe conscriptam; quo nomine me illi valde devinctum agnosco; atque hoc difficultatibus, quas proposuit, eluendis rescripsibo. Imprimis ait, longitudinem solaris Imaginis à refractione Prismatis effectam non aliâ indigere causâ quàm diversâ radiorum ab oppositis partibus solaris disci profluentium incidentiâ, adeóque non probare diversam refrangibilitatem diversorum radiorum. Et quo assertionis ejus veritatem confirmet, ostendit casum, in quo ex diversa incidentia diversorum 30minutorum, differentia refractionis potest esse 2grad., 23min. vel etiam paulo major, prout exigit meum experimentum. Sed extra oleas evagatus hallucinatus est R. P. Nam refractiones à diversa parte Prismatis quantum potest inæquales statuit, cùm tamen ego tum in experimentis, tum in calculo de experimentis istis inito, æquales adhibuerim, ut in Epistola præfata videre est. Sit ergo ABC Prismatis sectio ad axem ejus perpendicularis, FL et KG radij duo in X (medio foraminis) decussantes et in Prisma illud incidentes ad G et L: Sintque eorum refracti GH et LM, ac denuò HI et MN. Et cùm refractiones ad latus AC æquales esse refractionibus ad latus BC quamproximè supposuerim; si AC et BC statuantur æqualia, similis erit radiorum GH et LM ad AB basem Prismatis inclinatio; adeoque angCLM=angCHG et ang.CML=angCGH. Quare etiam refractiones in G et M æquales erunt, ut et in L et H; Xxxx 6atque adeò ang.KGA=angNMB, et ang.FLA=angBHI; et proinde refractorum HI et MN eadem erit ad invicem inclinatio ac est incidentium radiorum FL et KG. Sit ergo angulus FXK 30min., æqualis nempe solari diametro, et erit angulus, quem HI et MN comprehentdunt, etiam 30min., si modò radij FL et KG æqualiter refrangibiles statuantur. At mihi experienti prodijt angulus ille circiter 2grad., 49min. quem radius HI, extremum violaceum colorem, et MN cæruleum exhibens, constituêre; ac proinde radios illos diversimodò refrangibiles esse, sive refractiones secundùm disparem sinuum incidentiæ et refractionis rationem peragi necessariò concedendum est. Addit præterea R.P, quod non sufficit ad obeundum ritè calculum ex longitudine imaginis impactæ in Chartam subtrahere magnitudinem foraminis fenestræ, quandoquidem etiam posito foramine indivisibili, adhuc fieret aliud veluti foramen latum in posteriori superficie prismatis. Mihi tamen videtur, his non obstantibus, quòd refractiones radiorum, in anteriori æqué ac in posteriori superficie Prismatis decussantium, ex adhibitis principijs possint ritè computari. Sed si res secùs esset, latitudo hiatûs in posteriori superficie, quod ad instar foraminis est, haud efficeret errorem duorum minutorum secundorum, & in rebus practicis non operæ pretium duco ad minutias istas attendere. Illi insuper experimento, quod Crucis vocaverim, nihil adversatur R.P, dum contendit, inæquales radiorum, diversis coloribus impbutorum, refractiones ex inæqualibus incidentijs effectas fuisse. Nam radijs per duo admodum parva, ab invicem distantia, et immota foramina transeuntibus, incidentiæ illæ, prout ego experimentum institui, omninò æquales erant, et tamen refractiones liquidò inæquales. Sin ille de experimentis nostris dubitet, exoro ut radiorum diversis coloribus præditorum refractiones ex incidentijs paribus mensuretur, et sentiet inæquales esse. Si modus ille, quem ego ad hoc negotium adhibui, minùs placeat (quo tamen nullus potest esse luculentior,) facile est alios excogitare; sicut et alios ipse haud paucos cum fructu expertus sum. Contra Theoriam de cColoribus objicitur, quòd pulveres diversoruum colorum permisti non candidum sed subobscurum et fuscum colorem exhibent. Mihi verò albus, niger et omnes intermedij fusci, qui ab albo et nigro permistis componi possunt, non specie coloris sed quantitate lucis tantùm differre videntur. Et cùm in mistione pigmentorum, singula corpuscula non nisi proprium colorem reflectant, adeóque maxima Xxxx 7pars lucis incidentis supprimatur et retineatur; lux reflexa subobscura evadet, et quasi cum tenebris permista adeó ut non intensuumum alborem, sed qualem nigredinis permistio conficit, hoc est, fuscum, exhibere debeat. Objicitur deinde, quòd a liquoribus quibuscunque diversi coloris in eodem vase commistis æquè ac in diversis vasibsus vasis contentis opacitas oriri debet, quod tamen, ait, verum non esse. Sed non video consequentiam. Nam plurimi liquores agunt in se invicem, et novam sibi mutuò partium contexturam secretò inducunt; unde opaci, diaphani, vel varijs coloribus, ex coloribus permistorum nullo modo oriundis, præditi evadere possunt. Et hâc de causâ experimenta hujusmodi minùs apta semper existimavi, à quibus conclusiones dedudci possint. Subnoto tamen, quòd ad hoc experimentum requiruntur liquores saturis et intensis coloribus præditi, qui nullos perpaucos nisi proprij coloris radios transmittant; quales rarò occurrunt, ut videbitur illuminando liquores cum diversis coloribus Prismaticis in obscurato cubiculo. Nam pauci reperientur, qui in proprijs coloribus 9. satis diaphani appareant, inque alienis opaci. Convenit præterea, ut adhibiti colores sint inter se oppositi, quales existimo fore rubrum et cæruleum, vel flavum et violaceum, vel etiam viridem et purpureum illum qui coccineo affinis est. Et ex hujusmodi liquoribus nonnulli (quorum partes tingentes non congredientur) fortasse permisti evadent opaciores. Sed de eventu nihil sum sollicitus, tum quod luculentius est experimentum in liquoribus seorsim existentibus, tum quod experimentum illud (sicut et Iridis, Tincturæ Nephriticæ, et aliorum corporum naturalium phænomena) non ad probandam sed ad illustrandam tantum doctrinam proposui. Quòd R.P. Theoriam nostram Hypothesin vocat, amicè habeo, siquidem ipsi nondum constet. Sed alio tamen consilio proposueram, & nihil aliud continere videtur quàm proprietates quasdem Lucis, quas jam inventas probare haud difficile existimo, et quas si non veras esse cognoscerem, pro futili et inani speculatione mallem repudiare, quàm pro meâ Hypothesi agnoscere.

Sir This day fortnight I received your letter accompanied with part of the remaines of Mr Horrox, two Tracts of Honorato Fabri, & 4 or 5 Coppies of a Synopsis of Mr Kersies Algebra. For these & Dr Wallis his Mechanicks together with many other civilities I must acknowled your Obligingnesse & affection to me, & shall be ever ready to testify as much. Nor is your Mathematicall Intelligence lesse gratefull; for I am very glad that Dr Barrow's Book is abroad in the world & that the world will enjoy the writings of the excellent Astronomers Mr Horrox & Hevelius & those complete Mathematicians Monsieur Huygens & Slusius. Your Kindnesse to me also in profering to promote the edition of my Lectures which Dr Barrow told you of, I reccon amongst the greatest, considering the multitude of buisinesse in which you are involved. But I have now determined otherwise of them; finding already by that little use I have made of the Presse, that I shall not enjoy my former serene liberty till I have done with it; which I hope will be so soon as I have made good what is already extant on my account. Yet I may possibly complete the discourse of resolving Problemes by infinite series of which I wrote the better half the last christmas with intension that it should accompany my Lectures, but it proves larger then I expected & is not yet finished. The Book here in Presse is Varenius his Geography, for which I have described Schemes; & I suppose it will be finished about six weeks hence. The additions to Kinkhuysens Algebra I have long since augmented with what I intended, & particularly with a discourse concerning invention or the way of bringing Problems to an Æquation. And those are at your command. If you have not determined any thing about them I may possibly hereafter review them & print them with the discourse concerning Infinite Series. I take much satisfaction in being a Member of that honourable body the Royal Society; & could be glad of doing any thing which might deserve it: Which makes me a little troubled to find my selfe cut short of that fredome of communication which which I hoped to enjoy, but cannot any longer without giving offence to some persons whome I have ever respected. But tis no matter, since it was not for my own sake or advantage that I should have used that fredome. The Coppies of the Synopsis of Mr Kersies Algebra I have communicated to our Mathematicians, but meet not with any substcriptions. However to encourage the undertaking I shall subscribe for one, & hope ere long to send you another or two. For my tardinesse in returning you this Answer I have no other excuse but that I stayed 4 or 5 days in hopes to send you some of those subscriptions, & being intent upon the duty of this Terme, the time slipt on faster then I was aware of.

Sir, Where I find you concern'd, I cannot omit giuing you notice of it, and 'tis vpon that score, that, though I wrote to you but the other day, when I sent you Monsieur Hugens's book de Motu Pendulorūum (which was on Thursday last by your carrier,) I make so much haste of writing to you again, that so I may acquaint you with some particulars, come since come to my hands in a letter from the same M.

Cependant que veut dire, ie vous prie, qu'il avance, que quand mesme ie luy aurois montré que le blanc se peut composer de deux seules couleurs primitives, ie n'en pourrois pourtant rien conclurre contre luy, et cependant. il a dit pag. 3083. des Transactions, que pour composer le blanc, toutes les couleurs primitives sont necessaires. Quant à la maniere dont il concilie l'effet des verres convexes à assembler si bien les rayons, auec ce qu'il establit touchant la differente refrangibilité; I'en suis satisfait: mais aussi doit il avouër, que cette aberration des rayons ne nuit donc pas tant aux voiz verres, qu'il semble auoir voulu faire à croire, quand il a proposé les miroirs concaves comme la seule esperance de perfectioner les Telescopes. Son Invention assurement estoit tres-belle, mais, à ce que i'ay pû conoitre par l'experience, le defaut dela matiere la rend presque aussi impossible d'executer, que la difficulté dela forme repugne aux Hyperboles de M. des Cartes: de sorte qu'à mon avis il en faudra deneurer à nos verres spheriques, auxquels nous auons desia tant d'obligation, et qui peuvent recevoir encor plus grande perfection tant par l'augmentation dela longueur des lunettes, que par la correction dela matiere du verre mesme.

Hugens would conclude any thing, he must show, how white may be produced out of two vncompoundded colors; which when he hath done, I will further tell him, why he can conclude nothing from that? This, I suppose, was not said by you in contradiction to that paragraph of p. 3083. in Transactions, but with refe[33]rence to the main import of your Theory, viz. that that would not be overthrown by it, though perhaps that part concerning the composition of whiteness should fall.

Pardies of May 21. 1672; mentioned in the foregoing Letter. to the Priest.In Observationibus Reverendi Patris I. Pardies, quas ad te denuò conscripsit, an majus sit Ingenij et Humanitatis argumentum quòd meis responsionibus vim omnem attribuit; et agnoscit, an Ingenii, an quòd Objectiones proponit, quæ, si non probe tollantur, Doctrinam nostram illudere et frustrari possint, vix possum diexereim. Utrumque sanè ad determinandam veritatem optimè conducuitnt, et efficiuntquet ut acceptis quàm lubentissimè respondeam. Ait Reverendus Pater quod absque variâ diversorum radiorum refrangibilitate possibile sit reddere explicare longitudinem colorum; quemadmodum putá ex Hypothesi P. Grimaldi, per diffusionem luminis, quod supponitur esse substantia quædam rapidissimè mota; vel ex Hypothesi Hookij nostri, per diffusionem vel expansionem Undulationum, quas statuit in æthere à lucidis corporibus excitatas quaquaversum propagari. Addo, quód ex Hypothesi Cartesiana potest etiam effingi consimilis diffusio conatûs vel pressionis globulorum, perinde ut in explicatione Caudæ Cometæ supponitur. Et eadem diffusio vel expansio juxta aliam quamvis Hypothesin, in qua lumen statuitur esse vis, actio, qualitas, vel substantia quælibet à luminosis corporibus undique emissa, effingi potest. Ut his respondeam, animadvertendum est, quòd Doctrina illa, quam de Refractione et coloribus explicui, in quibusdam Lucis Proprietatibus solummodó constitit, neglectis Hypothesibus per quas Proprietates illæ explicari debent. Optimus enim et tutissimus philosophandi modus videtur, ut imprimis rerum Proprietates diligenter inquiramus, et per experimenta faciamus stabilitas stabiliamus, ac dein tardius contendamus ad Hypotheses pro earum explicatione. Nam Hypotheses ad explicandas rerum proprietates tantùm accommodari debent, et non ad determinandas usurpari, nisi quatenus experimenta subministrare possint. Et siquis ex solá Hypothesium possibilitate de veritate rerum conjecturam faciat, non video quo pacto quicquam certi in qualibet ulla scientia determinare potesssit; siquidem alias atque alias Hypotheses semper liceat excogitare, quæ novas difficultates suppeditare videbuntur. Quamobrem ab Hypothesiuum contemplatione, tanquam improprio argumentandi Loco, hîc abstinendum esse censui, et vim Objectionis abstrahendam esse, ut pleniorem et magis generalem responsionem accipiat. Itaque per Lumen intelligo quodlibet Ens vel entis potestatem (sive sit Substantia, sive quævis ejus vis, actio, vel qualitas) quod à corpore lucido rectà pergens aptum sit ad excitandam visionem; et per radios Luminis intelligo minimas vel quaslibet indefinitè parvas ejus partes, quæ ab invicem non dependent, quales sunt illi omnes radij, quos lucentia corporisa vel simul vel successivè secundùm rectas lineas emittunt. Nam illæ tum collaterales tum successivæ partes luminis sunt independentes; siquidem unæ absque alijs intercipi possint, et in quaslibet plagas seorsim reflecti vel refringi. Et hoc præcognito, Objectionis vis omnis in eo sita erit; qQuòd colores per aliquam Luminis ultra foramen diffusionem, quæ non oritur ab Aaaaa 5inæquali diversorum radiorum (seu luminis independentium partium) refrangibilitate, in longum diduci possint. Quòd autem non aliunde oblongentur, monstravi in Literis relatis in Phil. Transactionibus, Num: 80. Et ut rationes facilius percipiantur, non gravabor jam fusiùs explicare. Scilicet ex observatione, quòd radij post refractionem non incurvabantur, sed rectâ progredi ad parietem progressi fuêre, patuit, eandem fuisse eorum ad se mutuò inclinationem cùm modò exiêrunt Prismate, atque cùm impegêrunt in parietem; Et et proinde Longitudo colorum ex inclinatione radiorum emersit quam inter refringendum obtinuêre, hoc est, ex quantitate refractionis quam singuli radij in Prismate patiebantur: Adeóque cùm colorum longitudo latitudinem aliquot vicibus ex observatione superaverit, sequitur, majorem fuisse inequalitatem refractionum quàm potuit oriri ex inæqualitate incidentiarum. Quinimò ex figura imaginis coloratæ, quòd nempe notn fuit Ovalis, sed ad latera duabus parallelis rectis lineis terminata, patuit, eam ex indefinitè multis imaginibus Solis, per inæqualem refractionem in longum distractis et serie continuâ dispositis, constitui; adeóque radios a singulis partibus solaris Disci provenientes per totam ferè longitudinem colorum dispergi; et proinde similiter incidentium inæquales esse refractiones. Id quod alijs etiam indicijs ostendi posset. Constat itaque diversas esse refractiones, ubi pares sunt incidentiæ8. incidentiæ. Sed amplius inquirendum est, Unde oriatur illa diversitas; aAn sit à causa aliqua incerta et irregulari, vel certâ lege, secundùm quam radius quilibet aptus est determinatam aliquam refractionem pati. Per incertas et irregulares causas intellige asperitates in superficie, vel venas diversisæ densitatis in interiorei parte vitri ex quo Prisma conflatur; item irregularem situm pororum, quos nonnulli ob luminis transmissionem directo tramite per vitrum omnifariam trajici statuunt; nec non tremores et inæquales commotiones partium ætheris, aëris, vel vitri; radiorum in refringente superficie se mutuò fortasse comprimentium resulturam ab invicem; ejusdem cujusque radij divisionem ac dissipationem in partes divergentes, quas vel numero finitas vel indefinitè multas in superficie aliquâ continuatim jacentes imaginari liceat; vel quamvis aliam diffusionem et dilatationem Luminis quam possumus excogitare, non ortam ex diversa prædispositione cujusque radij ad refractionem, in certo aliquo et constanti gradu patiendam. Quod autem diversa a refractio non orta sit ex ullis ejusmodi causis incertis et irregularibus, probavi per Experimentum duorum consimilium Prismatum in contrario situ juxta-positorum, ita ut posterius contrariâ suâ refractione retro-flecteret radios, et sic irregulares effectus prioris destrueret, sed per iteratas refractiones augeret irregulares. Utpote si prius Prisma diffunderet ac divergere faceret parallelos radios; e.g. per asperam polituram, inæquabilem densitatem, aut irregularem situm pororum Prismatis; vel per tremulos motus partium ætheris aëris aut vitri; vel per dilatationem luminis propter partium ejus (i.e. radiorum) se mutuò comprimentium relaxationem versus adjacentia spatia, quæ vel nullo vel minùs constipato lumine irradiantur; Aaaaa 6vel denique per cujusque radij dilatationem aut diffractionem in complures divergentes radios: tum sanè posterius Prisma magis diffunderet ac dissiparet radios per dictas irregularitates ætheris, aëris, aut vitri, vel per iteratam dilatationem luminis à refringentis superficiei resistentia denuò constipati ac diffusi, vel etiam per cujusque radij à priori diffractione orti iteratam diffractionem ac divisionem in longè plures divergentes radios. Et sic Lumen magis dispergeretur per refractionem secundi Prismatis, et in Parietem projectam Imaginem duplo longiorem effi minimùm exhiberet, quàm per solam refractionem prioris Prismatis exhiberi potuisset. Quamobrem cùm, experientiâ teste, refractio secundi Prismatis adeò non dispergat lumen ut contrahat et in pristinum statum reducat, efficiatque ut in forma Coni postea progrediatur, perinde ac si nullam omnino refractionem passum fuisset; concedendum est, quod Diffusionem Luminis, à refractione anterioris Prismatis effectam, non oritur oriri ab aliqua præfatarum causarum, aut alia quavis irregularitate, sed diversæ refrangibilitati diversorum radiorum solummodo tribuendam este, utpote quâ radius unusquisque, ex insita dispositione tantam refractionem in posteriorei Prismate ac in priori passus, reducitur in parallelismum cum seipso; et sic omnes radij ad se mutuò easdem inclinationes resumunt quas ante refractiones habuêre. Demum, ut hæc omnia summè confirmarem, adjeci Experimentum illud quod jam nomine Crucis passim insignitur: esse contigit: de cujus conditionibus cùm Reverendo Patre dubitaverit, placuit jam designare Schemate. Sit BC anterior tabula, cui Prisma A immediate præfigitur, sitque DE altera tabula, quasi duodecim pedibus abinde distans, cui suffigitur alterum Prisma F.

Atque ita ex mensura constat radios, diversis coloribus affectos, habere diversas leges refractionum. Sed suspicor unde adductus est sit Reverendus Pater in dubitationem; nempe videtur collocasse primum Prisma A post Tabulam BC, atque ita convertendo circa Axem, verisimile est inclinationem radiorum qui interjacent foramina propter intermediam refractionem fuisse mutatam.

Ex abundanti placet observare, quòd in hoc Experimento colorata Lux ob refractionem secundi Prismatis longe minùs diffunditur ac divaricat, quàm cùm alba existit, adeò ut imago ad G vel H sit pené circularis; præsertim si Prismata statuantur parallela et in contrario situ angulorum, prout in Schemate designantur. Quinetiam, si præterea diametdiameter foraminis y_ adæquet latitudinem colorum, nulla erit ejusdem coloratæ lucis in longum diffusio; sed imago, quæ à quopiam colore ad G vel H effingitur, (positis circularibus foraminibus, et refractione posterioris Prismatis non majori quàm prioris, radijsque ad obstaculum quàm proximè perpendicularibus,) erit planè circularis. Id quod arguit diffusionem, de qua supra egimus, non ex contagione vel continuitate materiæ undulantis aut celerrimè motæ vel similibus causis ortam esse, sed ex certa refractionum cujusque generis radiorum lege. Cur autem Imago illa in uno casu sit circularis, et in alijs nonnihil oblongata, et quomodo diffusio lucis in longitudinem in quolibet casu pro arbitrio minui potesssit, à Geometris determinandum et cum experientia conferendum relinquo. Postquam Proprietates Lucis his et similibus experimentis satis exploratæ fuerint, spectando radios tanquam ejus sive collaterales sive successivas partes, de quibus experti simus per independentiam quod sint ab invicem distinctæ; Hypotheses exinde dijudicandæ sunt, et quæ non possunt conciliari rejiciendæ. Sed levissimi negotij est, accommodare Hypotheses ad hanc Doctrinam. Nam siquis Hypothesin Cartesianam defenderedere velit, dicendum est, quod globulos sunt esse inæquales; vel quòd pressiones globulorum sunt esse alias alijs fortiores, et inde diversimodè refrangibiles, et aptas ad excitandam sensationem diversorum colorum. Et sic juxta Hypothesin Cl. Hookij dicendum est, quod Undulationes ætheris sunt esse alias majores sive crassiores alijs. Atque ita in cæteris. Hæc enim videtur esse summè necessaria Lex et Conditio Hypothesium, in quibus Naturalia corpora ponuntur constare ex quàm plurimis corpusculis acervatim contextis, ut à diversis lucentium corpusculis, vel ejusdem corpusculi diversis partibus (prout motu, figurâ, mole, aut alijs qualitatibus differunt) inæquales pressiones, motiones aut mota corpuscula per æthera quaquaversum trajiciantur, ex quibus, confusè mistis, lux constitui supponetur. Et nihil durius esse potest in istis Hypothesibus quàm contraria suppositio.Aaaaa 8 Ex apertura sive dilatatione Lucis in posteriori facie Prismatis, quam Reverendus Pater dixit esse veluti foramen, sufficit, quod error non emerget sensibilis si scilicet ob dam laborem accuratè juxta Observationes instituto. si modò aliquis emergeret. Quòd Quòd si calculus juxta Observationes præcisè ineatur, error erit nullus. Nam diametro foraminis à longitudine Imaginis subductâ, restabit longitudo quam Imago haberet si modò foramen ante Prisma esset indivisibile; idque non obstante præfatâ lucis dilatatione in posteriori facie Prismatis; ut facilè ostenditur. Deinde ex data illa longitudine Imaginis, ac distantia à foramine indivisibili, ut et positione et forma Prismatis, et ad id inclinatione ad incidentium radiorum, ac angulo quem refracti radij, ad medium Imaginis tendentes, cum à centro Solis incidentibus constituunt, cætera omnia determinantur. Et quæ determinant refractiones et positiones radiorum, sufficiunt ad calculum istarum refractionum ritè ineundum. Sed res non tanti esse videtur ut moram inferat. Quòd Reverendus Pater Doctrinam nostram Hypothesin vocaverit, non aliunde factum esse credo quàm quòd Vocabulum urssurpavit quod primùm occurrit; siquidem mos obtinuit ut quicquid exponitur in Philosophia dicatur Hypothesis.

160,Isaac Newton,Science,,"MS Add. 3976, ff. 18r-27v",11 July [June] 1672,England,"['English', 'Latin']","Cambridg. july 11. 1672. I have already told you that at the perusall of Mr Hooks Considerations on my Letter concerning Refractions & ColoursPh. Trans. N. 88 p. 5084, I found nothing that as I conceived might not without difficulty be answered. But I must confesse at the first receipt of those Considerations I was a little troubled to find a person so much concerned for an Hypothesis, from whome in particular I most expected an unconcerned & indifferent examination of what I propounded. But yet I doubt not but we have one common designe, a sincere endeavour after knowledg, without valuing uncertain speculations for their subtleties, or despising certainties for their plainesse: And on confidence of this it is that I make this returne to his Discourse 1. Of the Practique part of Optiques.The first thing that offers it selfe is lesse agreable to me, & I begin with it because it is so. Mr Hook thinks himselfe concerned to reprehend me for laying aside the thoughts of improving Optiques by Refractions. But he knows well that it is not for one man to prescribe Rules to the studies of another, especially not without understanding the grounds on which he proceeds. Had he obliged me by a private letter on this occasion, I would have acquainted him with my successes in the tryalls that I have made of that kind, which I shall now say have been lesse then I sometimes expected, & perhaps lesse then he at present hopes for. But since he is pleased to take it for granted that I have let this Subject passe without due examination, I must referre him to my former letter, by which that Conjecture will appeare to be ungrounded. For what I said there, was in respect of Telescopes of the ordinary construction, signifying that their improvement is not to be expected from the well figuring of Glasses as Opticians have imagined. But I despaired not of their improvement by other constructions, which made me cautious to insert nothing that might intimate the contrary. For although successive refractions which are all made the same way, doe necessarily more & more augment the errors of the first refraction; yet it seemed not impossible for contrary refractions so to correct each others inequalities, as to make their difference regular, & if 2 that could be conveniently effected, there would be no further difficulty. Now to this end I examined what may be done not onely by Glasses alone, but more especially by a complication of divers successive Mediums, as by two or more Glasses or Chriystalls with water or some other fluid between them, all which together may performe the office of one Glasse, especially of the Object-Glasse on whose construction the perfection of the Instrument cheiefely depends. But what the results in Theory or by Tryalls have been I may possibly find a more proper occasion to declare. To the assertion that rays are lesse true reflected to a point point by a Concave then refracted by a Convex, I cannot assent; nor do I understand that the focus of the latter is lesse a line then that of the former. The truth of the contrary you will rather perceive by this following Table computed for such a reflecting Concave & refracting Convex, on supposition that they have equall aApertures & collect parallel rays at an equall distance from their vertex. wWhich distance being divided into 15000 parts; the diameter of the concave Sphere will be 60000 of those parts, & of the convex 10000; supposing the sines of incidence & refraction to be in round numbers, as 2 to 3. And this Table shews how much the exterior rays at severall Apertures fall short of their principall focus. The diameter of the aperture The parts of the Axis intercepted between the Vertex & the rays The error by reflected. refracted. Reflexion.

By this you may perceive that the errors of the refracting Convex are So far from being the lesse, that they are more then sixteen times greater then the like errors of the reflecting Concave; especially in great aperture & that without respect to the heterogeneous constitution of light.. So that however the contrary supposition might make Mr Hook reject reflexions as uselesse for the promotionng of Optiques, yet I must for this as well as other considerations perefer them in the Thesory before refractions. Of the Theoretique part.This much concerning the practique part of Optiques, I shall Whether3[19] Whether the Parabola be more difficult to describe then the Hyperbola or Ellipsis, may be a query: But I see no absolute necessity of endeavouring after any of their descriptions. For if Metalls can be ground truly sphericall, they will beare as great apertures as I beleive men will be well aptble to communicate an exact polish to. And for dDioptrique Telescopes I told you that the difficulty consisted not in the figure of the glasse but in the difformity of refractions. Which if it did not, I could tell you a better & more easy remedy then the use of the Conic Sections. 2. Of the Theoretique part.Thus much conerning the Practique part of Optiques. I shall now take a view of Mr Hooks Considerations on my Theories. And those consist in ascribing an Hypothesis to me which is not mine; in asserting an Hypothesis which as to the principall parts of it is not against me; in granting the greatest part of my discourse if explicated by that Hypothesis; & in denying some things the truth of which would have appeared by an experimentall examination. Of these particulars I shall discourse in order. And first of the Hypothesis which Mr Hook hath assigned me in these words: But grant his first supposition that light is a body, & that as many colours or degrees thereof as there may be so many bodies there may be, all which compounded together would make white &c. This it seemes Mr Hook takes for my Hypothesis. 'Tis true that from my Theory I argue the corporeity of light, but I doe it without any absolute positivenesse, as the word perhaps intimates, & make it at most but a very plausible consequence of the Doctrine, & not a fundamentall supposition, but nor so much as any part of it, which was wholly comprehended in the precedent Propositions. And I wonder how Mr Hook could imagin that when I had asserted the Theory with the greatest rigor, I should be so forgetfull as afterwards to assert the fundamentall, supposition it selfe with no more then a perhaps. Had I indtended any such Hypothesis I should somewhere or other have explained it. But I knew that the Properties which I declared of light were in some measure capable of being explicated, not onely by that, but by many other Mechanical Hypotheses. And therefore I chose to decline them all, & speake of light in generall termes, considering it abstractedly as something or other propagated every way in streight lines from luminous bodies, without determining what that thing is, whether a confused 4 mixture of difform qualities, or modes of bodies, or of bodies themselves, or of any virtues powers or beings whatsoever. And for the same reason I chose to speake of Colours according to the information of our senses, as if they were qualities of light without us. Whereas by that Hypothesis I must have considered them rather as modes of sensation excited in the mind by various motions motions figures or sizes of the corpuscles of light making varioius Mechanicall impressions on the Organ of sSense, as I expressed it in that place where I spake of the corporeity of Light. But supposing I had propounded this Hypothesis, I understand not why Mr Hook should so much endeavour to oppose it. For certainly it hath a much greater affinity with his own Hypothesis then he seemes to be aware of: the vibbrations of Æther being as usefull & necessary in this, as in his own. For assuming the rays of Light to be small bodies emitted every way from shining substances, those when they impinge on any refracting or reflecting superficies, must as necessarily excite vibrations in the Æther, as stones do in water when thrown into it. And supposing these vibrations to be of severall depths or thicknesses, accordingly as they are excited by the said corpuscular rays of various sizes & velocities; of what use they will be for explicating the manner of reflexion & refraction, the production of heate by the sun beames, the emission of light from burning putrifying or other subtstances whose pars are vehemently agitated, the Phænomena of thin transparent plates & bubbles, & of all naturall bodies, the manner of vision, & the difference of colours, as also their Harmony & Discord, I shall leave to their consideration who may think it worth their endeavour to apply this Hypothesis to the solution of Phænomena. 3. Of Mr Hooks Hypothesis, & that the most free & genuine constitution of that & afll other mechanicall Hypotheses is conformable to my Doctrin.In the second place I told you that Mr Hooks Hypothesis as to the fundamentall part of it. is not against me. The fundamentall supposition is, that the parts of bodies when bisquely agitated, do excite vibrations in the Æther, which are propagated every way from those bodies in streight lines, & cause a sensation of light by beating & dashing against the bottom of the eye, something after the manner that vibrations in the Air cause a sensation of Sound by beating against the Organs of hearing. Now the most free & naturall application of this Hypothesis to the solution of Phænomena I take to be this: That the agitated parts of bodies according to their severall sizes, figures, & velocities motions5[20]10d motions, excite vibrations in the Æther of various depths or bignesses, which being promiscuously propagated through that Medium to our eyes, effect in us a sensation of light of a white colour; but if by any meanes those of unequall bignesses be separated from one another, the largest beget a sensation of a rRed colour, the least or shortest of a deep Violet, & the intermediate ones of intermediate colours: Much after the manner that bodies according to their severall sizes shapes & motions, excite vibrations in the air of various bignesses, which according to those bignesses make severall tones in sound. That the largest Vibrations are best able to overcome the resistance of a refracting superficies, & so break through it with least refraction: Whence the vibrations of severall bignesses, that is, the rays of severall colours, which are blended together in light, must be parted from one another by refraction, & so cause the Phænomena of Prisms & other refracting substances. And that it depends on the thicknesse of a thin transparent Plate or Bubble, whether a vibration shall be reflected at its further superficies or transmitted; so that according to the number of vibrations interceding the two superficies they may be reflected or transmitted for many successive thicknesses, inAnd since the vibrations which may make Blew & Violet are supposed shorter then those which make Red & Yellow, they must be reflected at a lesse thicknesse of the Plate or bubble: which is sufficient to explicate all the ordinary Phænomena of those this Bodies Plates or Bubbles, & also of all naturall Bodies whose parts are like like so many fragments of such Plates. These seem to be the most planeine genuine & necessary conditions of this Hypothesis. And they agree so justly with my Theories, that if Mr Hook think fit to apply them, he need not on that account feare a divorce from it. But yet how he will defend it from other difficulties I know not: For to me the fundamentall supposition it selfe seemes impossible; namely that the waves or vibrations of any fluid can like the rays of Light be propagated in streight lines, without a continuall & very extravagant spreading & bending every way into the quiescent Medium where they are terminated by it. I am mistaken if there be not both Experiment & Demonstration to the contrary. And as to the other two or three Hypotheses which he mentions, I had rather beleive them Subject to the like difficulties, then suspect that Mr Hook should select the worst for his own. 6 What I have said of this, may be easily applyed to all other Mechanicall Hypotheses in which light is supposed to be caused by any pression or motion whatsoever excited in the Æther by the agitated parts of luminous Bodies. For tit seems impossible that any of those motions or pressions can be propagated in streight lines without the like spreading every way into the shaddowed Medium on which they border. But yet if any man can think it possible, he must at least allow that those motions or endeavours to motion caused in the Æther by the severall parts of any lucid body which differ in size figure & agitation, must necessarily be unequall. Which is enough to denominate light an aggregate of difform rays according to any of those Hypotheses. And if those originall inequalities may suffice to difference the rays in colour & refrangibility, I see no reason why they that adhere to any of those Hypotheses, should seek for other causes of these effects, unlesse (to use Mr Hooks argument) they will multiply entities without necessity. 4. Of Mr Hooks concessions, & their limitation to his Hypothesis.The third thing to be considered is the condition of Mr Hooks concessions, which is that I would explicate my Theories by his Hypothesis. And if I could but comply with him in that point there would be little or no difference between us. For he grants that without any respect to a different incidence of rays there are different refractions; but he would have it explicated not by the different refrangibility of severall rays, but by the splitting & rarefiying of æthereall pulses. He grants my third, fourth, & sixt Propositions, the sense of which is, that uncompounded colours are unchangeable, & that compounded colours are changeable onely by resolving them into the colours are changeable onely by resolving them into the colours of which they are compounded, & that all the changes which can be wrought in colours are effected onely by variously mixing or parting them: but he grants them on this condition that I will explicate colours by the two sides of a split pulse, & so make but two species of them, accounting all other colours in the world to be but various degrees & dilutings of those two. And hee further grants that whitenesse is produced by the convention of all colours but then I must allow it to be not onely by mixture of those colours, but by a further uniting of the parts of the ray supposed to be formerly split. If I would proceed to examin these his explications, I think it would be no difficult matter to shew that they are not7[21] What not onely insufficient, but in some respects unintelligible. For though it be easy to conceive how motion may be dilated & spread, or how parallel motions may become diverging, yet I understand not by what Artifice any linear motion can by a refracting superficies be infinitely dilated & rarefied so as to become superficiall; or if that be supposed, yet I understand as little why it should be split at so small an angle onely, & not rather spread & dispersed through the whole angle of refraction. And further though I can easily imagin how unlike motions may cross one another, yet I cannot well conceive how they should coalesce into one uniforme motion, & then part again & recover their former unlikenesse; notwithstanding that I conjecture the ways by which Mr Hook may endeavour to explain it. So that the direct uniform & undisturbed pulses should be split & disturbed by refraction, & yet the oblique & disturbed pluses persist without splitting or further disturbance by following refractions, is as unintelligible. And there is as great a difficulty in the number of colours as you will see hereafter. 5. That it is not necessary to limit or explain my Doctrin by any Hypothesis.But whatever be the advantages or disadvantages of this Hypothesis, I hope Mr Hook will excuse me from taking it up, since I do not think it needfull to explicate my Doctrine by any Hypothesis at all. For if lLight be considered abstractedly without respect to any Hypothesis, I can as easily conceive that the severall parts of a shining body may emit rays of differing colours & other qualities, of all which light is constituted, as that the severall parts of a false or uneaven string, or of uneavenly agitated water in a Brook or Cataract, or the severall Pipes of an Organe inspired all at once, or all the variety of sounding bodies in the world together, should produce sounds of severall tones, & propagate them through the Air confusedly intermixed. And if there were any naturall bodies which could reflect sounds of one tone & stifle or transmit those of another; then as the Echo of a confused aggregate of all tones would be that particular tone which the echoing body is disposed to reflect; so since (even by Mr Hooks concessions) there are bodies apt to reflect rays of one colour & stifle or transmit those of another, I can as easily conceive that those bodies when illuminated by a mixture of all colours must appear of that colour onely which they reflect. But when Mr Hook would inseinuate a difficulty in these things by alluding to sounds in the string of a musicall Instrument before percussion, or in the Air of an Organ Bellows before its arrivall at the Pipes, I must confesse I understand it as little as if he had spoke of light 8 in a piece of wodod before it be set on fire, or in the oyle of a Lamp before it ascend up the Match to feed the flame. 6. The difficulties of Mr Hooks Hypothesis discourse abstracted from Hypotheses & considered more generally.You see therefore how much it is besides the buisinesse in hand to dispute about Hypotheses: For which reason I shall now in the last place proceed to abstract the difficulties involved in Mr Hooks discourse, & without having regard to any Hypothesis consider them in generall termes. And they may be reduced to these three Queries. TWhether the unequall refractions made without respect to any inequality of incidence, be caused by the different refrangibility of severall rays, or by the splitting breaking or dissipating the seame ray into diverging parts; Secondly wWhether there be more then two sorts of colours; & whether whitenesse be a mixture of all colours 7. That the Ray is not split or any otherwise dilated.The first of these Queries you may find already determined by an experiment in my former Letter, the designe of which was to show that the length of the coloured Image proceeded not from any uneavennesse in the glasse, or any other contingent irregularity in the refractions. Amongst other irregularities I know not what is more obvious to suspect then a fortuitous dilating & spreading of light something after some such manner as Des-Cartes hath described in his æthereall refractions for explicating the Tayle of a Comet, or as Mr Hook now supposeth to be effected by the splitting & rarefying of his æthereall pulses. And to prevent the suspicion of any such irregularities, I told you that I refracted the light contrary ways with two Prisms successively, to destroy thereby the regular effects of the first Prism by the second, & to discover the irregular effects by augmenting them with iterated refractions. Now amongst other irregularities, if the first Prism had spread & dissipated every ray into an indefinite number of diverging parts, the second should in like manner have spread & dissipated every one of those parts into a further indefinite number, whereby the Image would have been still more dilated; contrary to the event. And this ought to have happened because those linear diverging parts depend not on one another for the manner of their refraction, but are every one of them ans truly & completely rays as the whole was before its incidence; as may appeare by intercepting them severally. The reasonablenesse of this proceeding will perhaps better appear by acquainting you with this further circumstance. I sometimes placed the second Prism in a position transferse to the first, on designe to try if it would make the long Image become four-9[22]10a four-square by refractions crossing those which had drawn the round Image into a long one. For if amongst other irregularities the refraction of the first Prism disd by splitting dilate a linear ray into a superficiall, the crosse refractions of that second Prism ought by further splitting to dilate & draw that superficiall ray into a pyramidall Solid. But upon tryall I found it otherwise, the image being as regularly oblong as before, and inclined to both the Prisms at an angle of 45 degrees. I tryed also all other mPomsitions of the second Prism by turning the ends about its middle mpart, & in no case could observe any such irregularity. The Image was ever alike inclined to both Prisms, its breadth equalling answering to the Suns diameter, & its length being greater or lesse accordingly as the refractions more or lesse agreed or contradicted one another. And by these observations since the breadth of the Image was not augmented by the crosse refractions of the second Prism, that refraction must have been performed without any splitting or dilating of the ray, & therefore at least the light incident on that Prism must be granted an aggregate of rays unequally refrangible in my sense. And since the Image was equally inclined to both Prisms, & consequently the refractions alike in both, Prisms it argues that they were performed according to some constant law without any irregularity. 8 That there are more than two originall colours.To determin the second Query Mr Hook refers to an experiment made with two wedge-like Bones, the designe of which was to produce all colours out of a mixture of two. But there is a double defect in this Instance. For it appeares not that by theis Experiment all colours can be produced out of two; & if they could yet the Inference would not follow. That all colours cannot by the Experiment be produced out of two, will appeare by considering that the tincture of Aloes which afforded one of those coloursObs 10 Microgr., was not all over of one uniform colour, but appeared yellow neare the edg of the Box, & red at the other places where it was thicker: affording all variety of colours from a pale Yellow to a deep red or scarlet according to the various thicknesse of the liquor. And so the solution of Copper which afforded the other colour was of various Blues & Indicos. So that instead of two colours here is a great variety made use of for the production of all others. Thus for instance, to produce all sorts of Greens, the severall degrees of Yellow & pale Blew must be mixed, but to 10 compound Purples, the Scarlet & deep Blew or Indico are to be the ingredients. Now if Mr Hook contend that all the Reds & Yellows of the one liquor, or Blews & Indicos of the other, are onely various degrees & dilutings of the same colour, & not divers colours, that is a begging of the Question; & I should as soon grant that the two Thirds or Sixts in Musick are but severall degrees of the same sound, & not divers sounds. Certainly it is much better to beleive our senses informing us that Red & Yellow are divers colours, & to make it a Philosophicall Query, why the same Liquor doth according to its various thicknesse appear of those divers colours, then to suppose them to be the same colour because exhibited by the same liquor. For if that were a sufficient reason, then Blew & Yellow must also be the same colour, since they are both exhibited by the same Tincture of Nephritick Wood. But that they are divers colours you will more fully understand by the reason of them; which is this. The Tincture of Aloes is qualified to transmit most easily the rays indued with red, most difficultly the rays indued with violet, & with intermediate degrees of facility the rays indued with intermediate colours. So that where the liquor is very thin it may suffice to intercept most of the Violet, & yet transmit most of the other colours; all which together must compound a middle colour, that is, a faint Yellow. And where ithe is so much thicker as also to intercept most of the Blew & Green also, the remaining Green Yellow & Red must compound an Orang. And where the thicknesse is so great that scarce any rays can passe through it besides those indued with Red, it must appeare of that colour, & that so much the deeper & obscurer by how much the liquor is thicker. And the same may be understood of the various degrees of Blew exhibited by the solution of Copper by reason of its disposition to intercept Red most easily & transmit a deep Blew or Indico colour most freely. But supposing that all colours might according to this experiment be produced out of two by mixture, yet it follows not that those two are the onely originall colours, & that for a double reason. First because those two are the onely originall colours not themselves originall colours but compounded o others; there being no liquor nor any other body in nature whose colour in day-light is wholly uncompounded. And then because though those two were originall & all others might be compounded of them, yet it follows not that they cannot be otherwise produced. For I sayd that11[23]10d they had a double origin, the same colours to sense being in some case compounded & in others uncompounded; & sufficiently declared in my third & fourth Propositions & in the Conclusion by what Properties the one might be known & distinguished from the other. But because I suspect by some circumstances that the Distinction might not be rightly apprehended, I shall once more declare it, & further explaine it by examples. That colour is primary or originall which cannot by any art be changed, & whose rays are all alike refrangible; & that compounded whoseich is changeable into other colours, & whose rays are not alike refrangible. For instance to know whether the colour of any Green Object be compounded or not, view it through a Prism, & if it appear confused, & the edges tinged with blew yellow or any variety of other colours, then is that Green compounded of such colours as at its edges emerge out of it. But if it appeare distinct, & &well defined, & intirely Green to the very edges without any other colours emerging, it is of an originall & uncompounded Green. In like manner if a refracted beam of light being cast on a white wall exhibit a Green colour, to know whether that he compounded, refract the Beam with an interposed Prism; & if you find any difformity in the refractions, & the Green be transformed into Blew Yellow or any variety of other colours, you may conclude that it was compounded of those colours which emerge. But if the refractions be uniforme, & the Green persist without any change of colour; then is it originall & uncompounded. And the reason why I call it so, is because a Green indued with such properties cannot be produced by any mixtureing of other colours. Now if two Green Objects may to the naked eye appeare of the same colour, & yet one of them through a Prism seem confused & variegated with other colours at the edges, & the other distinct & intirely Green; to the very edg or if there may be two beames of light which falling on a white wall do to the naked eye exhibit the same green colour, & yet one of them when transmitted through a Prism be uniformely & regularly refracted, & retain its colour unchanged, & the other be irregularly refracted & made to divaricate into a multitude of other colours: I suppose these two Greens will in both cases be granted of a different origine & constitution. And if by mixing other colours a Green cannot be compounded with the properties of the unchangeable Greesn; I think I may call that an uncompounded colour, especially since its rays are all alike refrangible, & uniform in all respects. The same rule is to be observed in examining whether Red, Orange, Yellow, Blew, or any other colour be compounded or 12 not. And by the way since all white Objetcts through the Prism appeare confused & terminated with colours; whitenesse must according to this distinction be ever compounded, & that the most of all colours, because it is the most confused & changed by refractions. From hence I may take occasion to communicate a way for the improvement of Microscopes by refraction; which I doe the more willingly because Mr Hook hath made such excellent use of that Instrument, & I shall be glad if it will contribute any thing to the promotion of those his ingenious endeavours, or add to his Inventions of that kind. The way is by illuminating the Object in a darkened Room with light of any convenient colour not too much compounded. For by that meanes the Microscope will with distinctnesse beare a deeper cCharge & larger aAperture; especially if its construction be such as I may hereafter describe. For the advantage in ordinary Microscopes will not be so sensible. 9. That whitenesse is a mixture of all colours.There remaines now the third Query to be considered, & that is, whether whitenesse be an uniform colour or a dissimilar mixture of all colours. The experiment which I brought to decide it Mr Hook thinks may be otherwise explaned, & so concludes nothing. But he might easily have satisfied himseflfe by trying what would be the result of a mixture of all colours. And that very Experiment might have satisfied him if he had examined it by the various circumstances. One circumstance I there declared of which I see no notise taken: & it is that if any colour at the Lens be intercepted, the whitenesse will be changed into the other colours. If all the colours but red be intercepted, that red alone in the concourse or crossing of the rays will not constitute whitenesse, but continues as much red as before; & so of the other colours. So that the businesse is not onely to shew how rayws which before the concours exhibit colours, doe in the concours exhibit white: But to show how in the same place where the severall sorts of rays apart exhibit severall colours, a confusion of all together make white. For instance if Red alone be first transmitted to the paper at the plce of concourse, & then the other colours be let fall on that Red, the question will be whether they convert it into white by mixing with it onely, as Blew falling on Yellow light is supposed to compound Green; or whether there be some further change wrought in the colours by their mutuall acting on one another, untill, like contrary Peripatetic Qualities, they become assimilated. And he that shall explicate this last case Mechanically must conquer a double impossibility. He must first show that many unlike motions in a fluid can be clashing so act on one another & change each other as to become13[24]10d become one uniform motion; & then that an uniform motion can of it selfe without any new unequall impressions, depart into a great variety of motions regularly unequall. And after this he must further tell me why all objects appeare not of the same colour, that is why their colours in the Air where the rays that convey them every way are confusedly mixed, doe not assimilate one another & become uniforme before they arrive at the Spectators eye. But if there be yet any doubting, tis better to put the event on further circumstances of the experiment, then to acquiesce in the possibility of any Hypotheticall Explication. As for instance by trying what will be the apparition of these colours in a very quick consecution of one another. And this may be easily performed by the rapid gyration of a wheel with many spoakes or coggs in its perimeter, whose interstices & thicknesses may be equall & of such a largenesse that if the wheel be interposed between the Prism & the white concourse of the colours, one half of the colours may be intercepted by a spoak or cogg & the other halfe passe through an interstice. The wheel being in this posture you may first turne it slowly about to see all the colours fall successively on the same place of the paper held at their afforesaid concours, & if you then accelerate its gyration untill the consecution of those colours be so quick that you cannot distinguish them severally, the resulting colour will be a whitenesse perfectly like that which an unrefracted beam of light exhibiteth when in like manner successively interrupted by the spoakes or Coggs of that circulating Wheel. And that this whitenesse is produced onely by a successive intermixture of the colours without their being assimilated or reduced to any uniformity, is certainly beyond all possibility of doubting, unlesse things that exist not at the same time may notwithstanding act on one another. There are yet other circumstances by which the truth might have been decided, as by viewing the white concourse of the colours through another Prism placed close to the eye, by whose refraction that whitenesse may appeare again transformed into colours. And then to examin their origin, if an Assistant intercept any of the colours at the Lens before their arrivall at the whitenesse, the same colours will vanish from amongst those into which that whitenesse is converted by the second Prism, Now if the rays which disappeare be the same with those that are intercepted, then it must be acknowledged that the second Prism makes no new 14 colours in any rays which were not in them before their concours at the paper. Which is a plane indication that the rays of severall colours remain distinct from one another in the whitenesse, & that from their previous dispositions are derived the colours of the second Prism. And by the way what is said of their colours may be applyed to their refrangibility. The aforesaid wheel may be also here made use of; And if its gyration be neither too quick nor too slow, the succession of the colours may be discerned through the Prism, whilst to the naked eye of a By-stander they exhibit whitenesse. There is something still remaining to be said of this Experiment. But this I conceive is enough to enforce it, & so to decide the controversy. However I shall now proceed to sho some other ways of producing whitenesse by mixtures, since I perswade my selfe that this assertion above the rest appeares Paradoxicall, & is with most difficulty admitted. And because Mr Hook desires an instance of it in bodies of divers colours, I shall begin with that. But in order thereto it must be first considered that such coloured bodies reflect but some part of the light incident on them, as is evident by the 13th Proposition; & therefore the light reflected from an aggregate of them will be much weakened by the losse of many rays. Whence a perfect & intense whitenesse is not to be expected, but rather a colour between those of light & shaddow, or such a grey or dirty colour as may be made by mixing white & black together. And that such a colour will result may be collected from the colour of dust found in every corner of a house, which hath been observed to consist of many coloured particles. There may be also produced the like dirty colour by mixing severall Painters colours together. And the same may be effected by painting a Top (such as Boys play with) of divers colours; for when it is made to circulate by whipping it will appear of such a dirty colour. Now the compounding of these colours is proper to my purpose because they differ not from whitenesse in the species of colour but onely in degree of luminousnesse. Which (did not Mr Hook concede it) I might thus evince. A beam of the Suns light being transmitted into a dakrkened Room if you illuminate a sheet of white paper by that light reflected from a body of any colour the paper will always appeare of the colour of that body by whose reflected light it is illuminated. If it be a red body, the paper will be red; if a green body, it will be green15[25] green; & so of the other colours. And the reason is that the fibers or threds of which the paper consists are all transparent & specular, & such substances are known to reflect colours without changing them. To know therefore to what species of colour a Grey belongeth, place any Grey body, (suppose a mixture of Painters colours) in the said light, & the Paper being illuminated by its reflexion shall appear white. And the same thing will happen if it be illuminated by reflexion from a black substance. These therefore are all of one species, but yet they seem to be distinguished not onely by degrees of luminousnesse, but also by some other inequalities whereby they become more harsh or pleasant. And the distinction seems to be that Greys & perhaps Black are made by an uneaven defect of light, consisting as it were of many little veines or streames which differ either in luminousnesse or in the unequall distribution of diversly coloured rays; such as ought to be caused by reflexion from a mixture of white & black or of diversly coloured corpuscles. But when such imperfectly mixed light is by a second reflexion from the paper more eavenly & uniformely blended, it becomes more pleasant, & exhibits a faint or shaddowed whitenesse. And that such little irregularities as these may cause these differences is not improbable if wee consider how much variety may be caused in sounds of the same tone by irregular & uneaven jarrings. And besides, these differences are so little that I have sometimes doubted whether they be any at all, when I have considered that a black & white body being placed together, the one in a strong light & the other in a very faint light so proportioned that they might appear equally luminous; it hath been difficult to distinguish them when viewed at distance, unlesse when the Black seemed more blewish, & the white body in a light still fainter hath in comparison of the black body it selfe appeared black. This leads me to another way of compounding whitenesse; which is, that if four or five Bodies of the more eminent colours, or a paper painted all over with in severall parts of it with those severall colours in a due proportion, be placed in the said beam of light, the light reflected from those colours to another white paper held at a convenient distance shall make that paper appeare white. If it be h eld too neare the colours, its parts will seem of those colours which are nearest them, but by removing it further that all its parts may be equally illuminated by all the colours, they will be more & more diluted untill they become16 become perfectly white. And you may further observe that if any of the colours be intercepted, the paper will no longer appeare white, but of the other colours which are not intercepted. Now that this whitenesse is a mixture of the severally coloured rays falling confusedly on the Paper, I see no reason to doubt of, because if the light became uniforme & similar before it fell on the paper, it must much more be uniforme when at a greater distance it falls on the spectators eye; & so the rays which come from severall colours would in no qualities differ from one another, but all of them exhibit the same colour to the Spectator, contrary to what he sees. Not much unlike this instance it is that if a polished piece of Metall be so placed that the colours appear in it as in a looking-glasse, & then the metall be made rough that by a confused reflexion those apparent colours may be blended together, they shall disappear, & by their mixture cause the Metall to look white. But further to enforce this experiment, if instead of the paper any white froth consisting of small bubbles be illuminated by reflexion from the afforesaid colours, it shall to the naked eye seem white, & yet through a good Microscope the severall colours will appear distinct on the Bubbles as if seen by reflexion from so many sphericall surfaces. With my naked eye being very neare I have also discerned the severall colours on each Bubble, & yet at a greater distance where I could not distinguish them apart, the Froth hath appeared intirely white. And at the same distance when I looked intently I have seen the colours distinctly on each Bubble, & yet by straining my eyes as if I would look at something far of beyond them, thereby to render the vision confused, the Froth hath appeared without any other colour then whitenesse. And what is here said of froth may easily be understood of the Paper or Metall in the foregoing Experiments. For their parts are specular bodies like these Bubbles: & perhaps with an excellent Telescope Microscope the colours may be seenalso seen intermixedly reflected from them. In proportioning the severally coloured Bodies to produce these effects there may be some nicenesse, & it will be more convenient to make use of the colours of the Prism cast on a wall by whose reflexion the Paper, Metall, Froth, & other white substances may be illuminated. And I usually made my tryalls this way because I could the better exclude any scattering light from mixing with the colours to dilute them. To this way of compounding whitenesse may be referred that other by mixing light after it hath been trajected through transparently coloured substances. For instance if no light be admitted into a Room but onely through coloured Glasse whose severalll17[26]10d severall parts are of severall colours in a pretty equall proportion: all white things in the Room shall appear white if they be not held too near the Glasse. And yet this light with which they are illuminated cannot possibly be uniforme, because if the rays which at their entrance are of divers colours, do in their progresse through the Room suffer any alteration to be reduced to an uniformity: the Glasse would not in the remotest parts of the Room appear of the very same colour which it doth when the Spectators eye is very near it. Nor would the rays when transmitted into another dark Room through a little hole in an opposite dDoor or partition Wall, project on a Paper the species or representation of the Glasse in its proper colours And by the way this seems a very fit & cogent instance of some other parts of my Theory, & particularly of the 13th Proposition. For in this Room all naturall bodies whatever appear of their proper colours. And all the Phænomena of colours in nature made either by refraction or without it are here the same as in the open Air. Now the light in this Room being such a dissimilar mixture as I have described in my Theory, the causes of all these Phænomena must be the same that I have there assigned. And I see no reason to suspect that the same Phænomena should have other causes in the open Air. The successe of this Experiment may be easily conjectured by the appearances of things in a Church or Chappell whose windows are of coloured Glasse; or in the open Air when it is illustrated with clouds of various colours. There are yet other ways by which I have produced whitenesse, as by casting severall colours from two or more Prisms upon the same place, by refracting a beam of light with two or three Prisms successively to make the diverging colours converge again, by reflecting one colour to another, & by looking through a Prism on an Object of many colours; &, which is equivalent to Mr Hooks way of mixing colours by concave wedges filled with coloured liquors, I have observed the shaddows of a painted glasse-window to become white where those of many colours have at a great distance interfered. But yet for further satisfaction Mr Hook he may try, if he please, the effects of four or five such wedges filled with liquors of as many severall colours. And Besides all these, the colours of water-bubbles, & other thin pellucid substances afford severall instances of whitenesse produced by their mixture; with one of which I shall conclude this pParticular. Let some water in which a convenient quantity of Soap 18 or wash-ball is dissolved, be agitated into a Froth, & after that Froth hath stood a whole without further agitation till you see the Bubbles of which it consists begin to break, there will appear a great variety of colours all over the top of every Bubble if you view them near at hand, but if you view them at so great a distance that you cannot distinguish the colours one from another, the froth will appear perfectly white. 10. That the Experimentum Crucis is such.Thus much concerning the designe & Substance of Mr Hooks Considerations. There are yet some particulars to be taken notice of; as the denyall of the Experimentum Crucis. On this I chose to lay the whole stresse of my discourse, which therefore was the principall thing to have been objected against. But I cannot be convinced of its insufficiency by a bare denyall without assigning a reason for it. I am apt to beleive it hath been misunderstood. For otherwise it would have prevented the discourseds about rarefying & splitting of rays, because the designe of it is to show that rays of divers colours considered apart do at equall incidences suffer unequal refractions, without being split, rarefied, or any ways dilated. 11. Some particulars recommended to further consideration.In the Considerations on my first & second Propositions Mr Hook hath rendered my Doctrin of unequall refrangibility very imperfect & maimed by explicating it wholly by the splitting of rays, whereas I chiefly intended it in those refractions which are performed without that supposed irregularity; such as the Experimentum Crucis might have informed him of. And in generall I find that whilst he hath endeavoured to explicate my Propositions Hypothetically, the more materiall suggestions by which I designed to recommend them, have escaped his consideration; such as are the unchangeablenesse of the degree of refrangibility peculiar to any sort of rays, the strict Analogy between the degrees of refrangibility & colours, the distinction between compounded & uncompounded colours, the unchangeablenesse of uncompounded colours, & the assertion that if any one of the Prismatique colours be wholly intercepted, that colour cannot be new produced out of the remaining light by any further refraction or reflexion whatsoever. And of what strength & efficacy these particulars are for enforcing the Theory I desire therefore may be now considered.This Article not Printed 12. That the Science of Colours is most properly a Mathematicall Science.In the last place I should take notice of a casuall expression which intimates a greater certainty in these things then I ever promised. viz: The certainty of Mathematicall Demonstrations. I said19[27] I said indeed that the Science of Colours was Mathematicall & as certain as any other part of Optiques; but who knows not that Optiques & many other Mathematicall Sciences depend as well on Physicall Principles as on Mathematicall Demonstrations: And the absolute certainty of a Science cannot exceed the certainty of its Principles. Now the evidence by which I asserted the Propositions of colours is in the next words expressed to be from Experiments & so but Physicall: wWhence the Propositions themselves can be esteemed no more then Physicall Principles of a Science. And if those Principles be such that on them a Mathematician may determin all the Phænomena of colours that can be caused by refractions, & that by computing or demonstrating after what manner & how much those refractions doe separate or mingle the rays in which severall colours are originally inherent; I suppose the Science of Colours will be granted Mathematicall & as certain as any part of Optiques. And that this may be done I have very good reason to beleive, because ever since I became first acquainted with these Principles, I have with constant successe in the events made use of them for this purpose. Thus much I have thought fit to returne to Mr Hooks Considerations: which that it may bring satisfaction in this part of Optiques to the Honourable Members of the R. Society hath been the Rule of my Intensions. Your humble Servant I. Newton",NATP00394,1672-07-11 00:00:00

215,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Letter from Newton to Henry Oldenburg, 6 July 1672",MS Add. 9597/2/18/19-20,6 July 1672,England,['English'],"19. An Extract of Mr Newtons letter to M. Oldenburg concerning the genuine method of determining the Truth of his Doctrine of Light and Colors. Stoake July 6t. 1672. Sir In yourthe inquiry which in yours of June the 25t you propound in these words: Whether a physicall point in a Glasse may not by the diversity of the pores & angles in it cause in the rays falling thereon such really different though seemingly equall refractions, that thence may proceed those severall distinct colours which in my Doctrine are esteemed to proceed from the aggregate if the rays if light? I know not what to understand by really different though seemingly equall refractions. For if you meane those different refractions from whence I denominate Light unequally refrangible, their differences are so great that they are far from being seemingly equall. And I apprehend not what other differences you should meane (if there be any other) since there is so constant & strict an Analogy between these & the severall species of colours. However since you suppose those unequall refractions to proceed from the diversity of pores & angles in the Glass, they must be comprehended under the contingent irregularities which I have already disproved in my Answer to Mr Hook & P. Pardies. And further if colours were originated from refractions as is supposed in your inquiry, then all colours would be changeable by refractions, contrary to what I find by experience. From either of these two heads, your inquiry is determined negatively, which if you think requisite I shall further explain hereafter. philosophical Transactions N. 85. p. 45004 — In the meane while give me leave to insinuate that I cannot think it effectuall for determining truth to examin the severall ways by which Phænomena may be explained, unlesse where there can be a perfect enumeration of all those ways. You know the proper Method for inquiring after the properties of things is to deduce them from Experiments. And I told you that the Theory which I propounded was evinced to me, not by inferring tis thus because not otherwise, that is not by deducing it onely from a confutation of contrary suppositions, but by deriving it from Experiments concluding positively & directly. The way therefore to examin it is by considering whether the experiments which I propound do prove those parts of the Theory to which they are applyed, or by prosecuting other experiments which the Theory may suggest for its examination. And this I would have done in a due Method; the Laws of Refraction being throughly inquired into & determined before the nature of colours be taken into consideration. It may not be amiss to proceed according to the series of these Queries: The decision of which I could wish to be stated, & the events attested declared by those that may have the curiosity to examin them. 1. Whether rays that are alike incident on the same Medium have unequall refractions, & how great are the inequalities of their refractions at any incidence? 2. What is the law according to which each ray is more or lesse refracted, whether it be that the same ray is ever refracted according to the same ratio of the sines of incidence & refraction; & divers rays, according to divers ratios; Or that the refraction of each ray is greater or lesse without any certain rule? That is, whether each ray have a certain degree of refrangibility according to which its refraction is performed, or is refracted without that regularity? 3. Whether rays which are indued with particular degrees of refrangibility, when they are by any meanes separated, have particular colours constantly belonging to them: viz, the least refrangible, scarlet; the most refrangible, deep violet; the middle, Sea-green; & others, other colours? And on the contrary? 4. Whether the colour of any sort of rays apart may be changed by refraction? 5. Whether colours by coalescing do really change one another to produce a new colour, or produce it by mixing onely? 6. Whether a due mixture of rays, indued with all variety of colours, produces light perfectly like that of the Sun, & which hath all the same properties & exhibits the same Phænomena? Between the 6t & 8th Query you may insert this in the 7th place [ 7. Whether the component colours of any mixture be really changed or onely separated, when out of that mixture various colours are again produced by refraction? ] 8. Whether there be any other colours produced by refractions then such, as ought to result from the colours belonging to the diversly refrangible rays by their being separated or mixed by that refraction? To determin by experiments these & such like Queries which involve the propounded Theory seemes the most proper & direct way to a conclusion. And therefore I could wish all objections were suspended, taken from Hypotheses or any other Heads then these two; Of showing the insufficiency of experiments to determin these Queries or prove any other parts or my Theory, by assigning the flaws & defects in my Conclusions drawn from them; Or of producing other Experiments which directly contradict me, if any such may seem to occur. For if the Experiments, which I urge be defective it cannot be difficult to show the defects, but if valid, then by proving the Theory they must render all other Objections insignificant & vaine invalid. ] In the margin of my Answer to Mr Hook I noted the contents of it in 12 Particulars, which when I came to number them in the Copy I found 13, so that there is either a marginall note omitted, or else slipt over without its number prefixt. If the last hath happened, you may prefix its number & alter the numbers of those that follow. But if the first, I will supply the note when I returne to Cambridge where my papers are, because ther may possibly be occasion of referring to that discourse hereafter. Sir I am Your humble Servant I. Newton 20. Yours dated June the 20th I doubt I shall not receive till my returne to Cambridge. I desire you would suspend the impression of P. Pardies second Letter.

Sir I am glad to find by the abstract of Monsieur Hugenis Letter which you transmitted to me, that he who hath done so much in Dioptricks hath been pleased to undertake the improvement of Telescopes by reflexions also, though without the desired success. For I hope the event of his next essay, if he shall think fit to attempt any thing further, will prove more happy by a little altering the manner of his proceeding. I should be glad to heare whether Mr Cock hath finished the four foot Telescope, & what its effects are, as also what are the best effects of those of 6 or 8 inches in length which he hath made at any time. But I know not whether I shall make any further tryalls my selfe, being desirous to prosecute some another subjects. Touching the Theory of Colours I am apt to beleive that some of the experiments may seem obscure by reason of the brevity wherewith I writ them which should have been described more largely & explained with schemes if they had been then intended for the publick. But I see not why the aberration of the rays from the transvers of the object-glass of a Telescope should be more then about 150 of the Glasses aperture. For suppose DF be the Lens; CD & EF two lines parallel to its axis in or indefinitely neare to which all variety of difform rays are successively incident on two opposite parts of its Perimeter. And of those rays let DH & FG be the most refracted & DG & FH the least refracted intersecting the former in G & H. Draw GH & produce it both ways till at M & N it occur with CD & EF also produced. Now since by my Principles the difference of refraction of the most difform rays is about the 24th or 25t part of their whole refraction, the angle GDH will be about a 25t part of the angle MDH & consequently the subtense GH (which is the diameter of the least space into which the refracted rays converge) will be about a 25t part of the subtens MH & therefore about a 49th part of the whole line MN the diameter of the lens; or in round numbers about a fiftith part as I asserted. This in hast Sir from Your Servant I.

Sir I think I told you that I had altered my resolution of printing my Dioptrick Lectures. And for the exercise about Infinite series I am not yet resolved, not knowing when I shall proceed to finish it. I will inquire of some of our Booksellers whether they will purchase Mr Pitts his copy of Kinckhuysen & if not I will send it you. In the meane while I would know whether Mr Pitts thinks it will be more advantageous to prindt the Author without alteration, or to insert those notes which you formerly saw, that I may according send them with the Copy or detain them. Mr Gregorys Problem of finding the solidity of the second segments of a Sphere & yours of finding the surfaces of inclined round solids may be solved divers ways by infinite sedries, as I find by considering them in generall, but I foresee the calculations are intricate & unpleasant which has made me neglect them, not thinking them worth transmitting to you. If I ever applyed Gundters Sector to the resolving of affected æquations it hath now slipt out of my memory. Possibly it might be Gunters line which being set upon 3 or 4 severall rulers is of ready use for finding the 2 or 3 first figures of any affected æquation but there is no difficulty in the invention. And if it be the same which you meane, you may command it. The way of resolving Problems æquations of 5 or 6 dimensions, by a locus linearis was I beleive by the intersection of that & a Conick Section, something after the manner that Des-Cartes hath done it, but more conveniently in my opinion, because the same locus linearis once described will serve for the resolving of all Problems Equations of those dimensions. And as I remember the calculations to that intent are shorter & lesse intricate. I am at present in Northampton shire whither your letter was sent to me from Cambridge: But hope within 8 or 9 days to be at Cambridge to receive what you may send thither if you shall have occasion to write to Your humble & much obliged Servant Newton.

And so you may P. Pardies second letter with my answer thereto since you desire it & have intimated to him that you would doe so in this month of July. I intended to suspend it for a while thinking it would be more convenient to print together what shall be said of this subject, especially since there are some other papers at Cambridg to be added to them. But if what hath passed be inserted into the Transactions to entertain them at present that are in expectation of further information about these matters, they may be hereafter reprinted by themselves if it shall be thought fit. I hope you have before this time received my thoughts upon Mr Hugens two particulars which therefore I shall not repeat. You will gratify me much by info acquainting me with the particular dimensions, fashion & successe of the four foot Tube which I presume Mr Cock by this time hath finished. And to inform my self of the advantages of the steely matter which is made use of, you will much oblige me if you can procure me a fragment of it. I suppose it is made by melting Steel with a little Antimony perhaps without separating the sulphureous from the metalline part of that mixture. And so though it may be very hard & capable of a good polish, yet I suspect whether it be so strongly reflective as a mixture of other Metalls. I make this inquiry because if I should attempt any thing further in the fabrick of the Telescope I would first inform my selfe of the most advantageous materialls. On which account also you will further oblige me if you can inquire whether Mr Cock or any other Artificer will undertake to prepare the Metalls, Glasse, Tube & Frame of a Four foot Telescope & at what rates he will do it so that there may remain nothing for me to do but to polish the Metalls. A gross account of this will at present suffice untill I send you a particular designe of the Fabrick of the Instrument if I resolve upon it. I presume John Stiles hath called at your house for your promise, which how slender soever you may esteem it will be very acceptable to Your humble Servant I.

Sir Since your last I have tryed the calculation for finding by an infinite series the content of the second segments of an Ellipsoid. The first series that I met with was this b02⁢r⁢b −b33⁢r −b520⁢r3 −b756⁢r5 &c } ab0 00−b3⁢r −b318⁢r3 −b540⁢r5 &c } a300 b0−b20⁢r3 −b340⁢r5 &c } a500 b0−b56⁢r5 &c a700 b0&c. Which upon comparison proved the same with Mr Gregories & therefore I have exprest it in the same letters. I tryed two or thre others, but could finefinde none more simple. Wherefore since I understand your designe is to get a rule for guageing vessells, Ithis Problem having so bad success for that end I shall in its stead present you with this following expedient. Let AFDA represent the vessell viewed endwise its perimeter at the middle being AFD, & at the end BEC, & the top of the liquor ABCD. Also let G be a circle whose semidiameter is equall yto the difference of the semidiameters of the other two circles AFD & BEC, & H the whole length of the vessel. Find by a table or instrument composed for that purpose, the segments AFD, & BEC, & the whole circle G; & 23⁢AFD+13⁢BEC−115⁢GinH shall be the whole quantity of the liquor in the vessel. This rule is not exact but approaches the content of the Parabolick spindle exactly enough for practice when the top of the liquor buts upon the end of the vessell. If the vessel be just half full tis exact; if more then half full, tis something to little; if lesse than half full, too much. The approximating the roots of affected Æquations by Gunters line is thus. Let the æquation for instance be x3−7⁢x⁢x+16⁢x−12=0: to resolve which place thre of Gunters Rulers BF, CG, & DH parallel & equally distant from one another, & to any line AE which crosseth then all apply the number 1 of the tfhirstd Ruler DH, the number 7 of the second, CG, & the number 16 of the first BF, accordingly as the coefficients of the æquation are. Then in the cross line taking the point A as far from B as B is from C apply any ruler to that point A, about which whilst you turne it slowly observe the numbers where it cuts the other rulers untill you see the summ of the other numbers on the first & third ruler equall to the sum of the resolvend 12 & the number on the other ruler, which when it happens the number on the 3d ruler shall be the cube of the desired root. Thus in this case you see 8+32=12+28, & therefore 8 the number on the 3d ruler is the cube of the desired root which consequently is 2. The application of this to any æquations of higher dimensions is obvious. As also so to proportion the rulers BF, CG, DH, &c that the line AK may be carried over them with parrallel motion. The description of a Conick section which shall pass through five given points is this. Let the five points be A, B, C, D, & E any three of which joyn to as A, B, & C joyn to make the a rectilinear triangle ABC, to any two angles of which as A & B apply two sectors, their poles to the angular points, & their leggs to the sides of the triangle. And so dispose them that they may turne freely abouth their poles A & B without varying the angles they are thus set at. Which done, apply to the other two points D & E successively their two leggs PQ & RS which were before applyed to C (which leggs for distinction sake may be called their describing leggs & the other two MN & TV which were applyed to AB, their describing directing leggs,) & marke the intersections of their directing leggs, which intersections suppose to be F when the application was made to D, & G when made to E. Draw the right line FG & produce it infinitely both ways. And then if you move the rulers in such manner that their directing leggs doe continually intersect one another at the line GF, the intersection of their other leggs shall describe the conic section which will pass through all the said five given points. If three of the given points lye in the same streight line tis impossible for any conick section to pass through them all, And in that case you shall have instead thereof two streight lines. Much after the same manner a Con. Sect. may be described which shall pass through 4 given points & touch a given line, or pass through 3 given points & tougch two given lines, whether those lines be right or curved. &c I presume it will not be an unpleasing speculation to your Mathematicians to find out the Demonstration of this Theorem. As also to determin the centers, diameters, axes, vertices, & Asymptotes of the Con. sect. thus described or to describe a Parabola which shall pass through 4 given points. And there I omit them. I herewith send you a set of Problems for construing æquations which that I might not forget them I heretofore set down rudely as you'le find. And therefore I think 'em not fit to be seen by any but your selfe, which therefore you may return when you have perused them. How the afforesaid descriptions are to be applyed to thof the Conick sections are to be applyed to these constructions I need not tell you. Borellius, of whom you desire my opinion, I esteem among the middle sort of Authors. I find not that he hath added any thing considerable to the sciences of motion but onely proved things already evidently known. Nor hath he done that without some Paralogisms, as in the proofs of the 2079th, 212th, & 260th Propositions. And some of them are not onely proved parallogistically but are also fals as 2 the 233d & those that depend on it, but yet he may be of good iuse to young students in Mechanicks.

To comply with your intimation of communicating Experiments proper for determining the Quæres which that Letter conteined I drew up a series of such Experiments on designe to reduce the Theory of colours to Propositions & prove each Proposition from one or more of those Experiments by the assistance of common notions set down in the form of Definitions & Axioms in imitation of the Method by which Mathematitians are wont to prove their doctrines.

Sir, I had no sooner receiued the favour of your answer to my last, but the forrain post brought me a pacquet out of italy from Signor Magalotti, Secretary to the Florentin Academy, and from another gentleman, both residing at Florence; giving me notice of some particulars, wherein you being concern'd, I cannot omit tohere to transcribe them for you. They are to this purpose; That one Signor Pietro Salvetti, havin one of the Great Dukes Musitians, having applied himself to the study of the mathematicks, and particularly to that of the Proportions of Harmony, as relating to his Profession of musick, began to delight himself in Opticks; and not being content with the Theory, attempted to putt it in practice by making Telescopes and microscopes in imitation of those of Campani and Divini: And that he lately shew'd one of his Microscopes to the G. Duke, which was Iudged by all much better than any of the best, his Highnes had; and that thesame same day he likewise shew'd his litle Highnes a litle Prospective Glass which he made according to Mr Newton's new invention, and although this was the first, and not above half a foot long, it had thesame effect as one of the common way of two foot. 'Tis added, that thesame person was going to make another of a bigger size after the conceit of M. Cassegrain; though he does not agree with thesaid Cassegrain, to make convexe that litle glass, which one looks into by means of the Eye-glass; and belieues withall (NB) that the this French man only thought vpon that contrivance, to disguise as much as was possible his pretended new Invention (which, by the by) is none of his,) which he endeavour'd to make appear anterior to Mr Newtons most noble one. So far my Correspondent of Florence; by which you see, that your productions are spred further than perhaps you are aware of: which, he thinks, should increase your rigour to prosecute and advance them to the vtmost, as well for your owne as the Nations honor. And this, I hope, will prove a motive to you to perfect, that is, to render indubitable to all, your new Theory of Light, and to take it again into consideration, as soon as conveniently you can, particularly by finishing and what by your last appears you haue now laid aside; I mean by drawing vp a series of Experiments tending to evince each part of that Theory. Having done with this, I am, before I conclude, to desire you to let me know, if without inconvenience you can, by the first, whether a young Chymist, that hath lived many years with Mr Boyle, and attained to good skill in that Art, as I am very credibly inform'd, he hath, I mean (call'd Mr Thom. Huyck) may, be repairing to Cambridge and there offring his service to ingenious and curious persons [29] for making with you a good course of Chymistry, find acceptance, and a competent reward for his skill and pains? If you think he may, he intends, God willing, forthwith to visit your University, and to endeavour soto approve himself, as may in some measure answer exspectation, and the recommends of Sir your humble and faithful servant Oldenburg. After I had written this, there comes to my hand a letter from Monsieur Hugenius, wherein are these laws touching your doctrine of Colors, viz. Ce que vous auez mis de Monsieur Newton dans vn de vos dernieres Transactions, confirme encor beaucoup sa doctrine des Couleurs.

223,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Letter from Newton to John Collins, dated 10 December 1672",MS Add. 9597/2/18/28-29,10 December 1672,England,"['English', 'Latin', 'Italian', 'French']","28. Cambridge. December 10th 1672. Sir My unwillingness to trouble you in the midst of your late dbuisiness made me suspend writing, though I stood obliged to thank you for the rest of Mr Horrox works which I received some weeks since. But by yours which I received two days since I presume the most of that trouble is over. I am heartily glatd at the acceptance which our Reverend friend Dr Barrow's Lectures finds with forreign Mathematicians, & it pleased me not a little to understand that they are falln into the same method of drawing Tangents with me. if What I guess their method to be you will apprehend by this example. Suppose CB applyed to AB in any given angle be terminated at any Curve line AC, and calling AB x & BC y let the relation between x & y be expressed by any æquation as x3−2⁢x⁢x⁢y+b⁢x⁢x−b⁢b⁢x+b⁢y⁢y−y3=0 whereby the curve is determined. To draw the tangent CD the Rule is this. Multiply the termes of the æquation by any arithmeticall progression according to the dimensions of y suppose thus x3−2⁢x⁢x⁢y+b⁢x⁢x−b⁢b⁢x+b⁢y⁢y−y3 010023 , also according to the dimensions of x suppose thus x3−2⁢x⁢x⁢y+b⁢x⁢x−b⁢b⁢x+b⁢y⁢y−y3 322100 . The first product shall be the Numerator, & the last divided by x the Denominator of a fraction which expresseth the length of BD to whose end D the tangent CD must be drawn. The length BD therefore is −2⁢x⁢x⁢y+2⁢b⁢y⁢y−3⁢y3 3⁢x⁢x−4⁢x⁢y+2⁢b⁢x−b⁢b . This Sir is one particular, or rather a Corollary of a Generall Method which extends it selfe without any troublesome calculation, not onely to the drawing tangents to all curve lines whether Geometrick or mechanick or how ever related to streight lines or to other curve lines but also to the resolving other abstruser kinds of Problems about the crookedness, areas, lengths, centers of gravity of curves &c. Nor is it (as Huddens method de maximis et minimis & consequently Slusius his new method of Tangents as I presume) limited to æquations which are free from surd quantities. This method I have interwoven with that other of working in æquations by reducing them to infinite series. I remember I once occasionally told Dr Barrow when he was about to publish his Lectures that I had such a method of drawing Tangents but some divertisment or other hindered me from descrdescribing it to him. Of resolving by Cardans rules Equations that have 3 possible roots there may be examples framed at pleasure, but unlesse bBrasser show a direct method of performing it, which Ferguson doth not, it will not be allowed scientifick. How it is to be done directly I may possibly show upon occasion. Mr Gregory is pleased to consider further the most advantageous construction of Catadioptricall Telescopes. And as his designe in his Optica promota excells that of M. Cassegrain (though they differ so sleightily that I thought it not worth the while to takeing notice of the difference) the advantage being that the little concave Ellipsis comes nearer to a sphericall figure then the convex Hyperbola; so I conceive his present designe proposall excells them both, of making that speculum plane. And this I conjecture is the way which Signor Salvetti one of the great Dukes Musitians mentioned in the last Transactions intends to make experiment of, excepting that instead of the convex eye glass he may probably substitute a concave one to erect the object. But yet I cannot think it the best it being liable to the 1st, 3d, & last of those difficulties which I urged against M. Cassegrain, & in my Judgment not wholly capable of the advantages which Mr Gregory propounds. The first disadvantage was that more light is lost in direct then oblique reflexion. I am convinced by severall observations that reflexion is not made by the solid parts of a body, as is commonly presumed, bput by the confine of the two Mediums whereof one is within, & the other without the body. And as stones are reflected by water when thrown obliquely which force their way into it when thrown directly downwards so light the rays of light (whether corporeall like stones or not) are most easily & copiously reflected when incident most obliquely. This you may observe in the passage of light out of glass into Air which is reflected more & more copiously as the obliquity is inclreased untill beyond a certain degree of obliquity it be wholly reflected. Also in the reflexion of light by an imperfectly polished plate of Brass or Silver or any other metall you may observe that the images of objects which by direct reflexion appear dull & confused, appiarappear by very oblique reflexion pretty distinct & vigorous. This advantage of oblique reflexion would be inconsiderable if metall reflected almost all the light directly incident on it, but so far as I can observe there is at least a third part if not the better half of the light lost & stifled in the metall at every reflexion ; & it is of some estimation if a third or 4th part of that can be redeemed by setting the flat speculum obliquely. As for Mr Gregory's insinuation that direct rays have the advantage of oblique because a direct ball is reflected more regularly from a rough wall then an oblique one, if he please to consider how different are the causes & circumstances of those reflexions, possibly upon second thoughts he may apprehend why the contrary ought to happen in light, at least the Experiment of the rudely polished plate of metall may perswade him. The next disadvantage arising from the distance of the little speculum from the eye-glass being allowed I pass to the last which is to this effect, That if to diminish the magnifying virtue of the instrument the little speculum be made of a larger sphære, whose center is infinitely distant (as it is in Mr Gregories designe, a plane being equivalent to a sphære whose center is infinitely distant,) that would cause too many of the best rays to be intercepted. And though in his designe scarce a fourth part of the whole light be intercepted yet those rays seem to me of more value then twice their number next the circumference of the Tube, because they principally conduce to distinct vision. Their loss will be judged considerable by those that have thought the loss of scarce the fort fortieth part of the light in my way worthy of being objected by reason that they were the best of the rays. There are yet other considerations by which Mr Gregory's Tube may perhaps be thought less advantageous, as that unless the speculum F be made so broade as to intercept more then a quarter or perhaps then a third part of the whole light, it will be difficult to inlarge the aperture as is requisite for viewing dull & obscure objects. That the eye-glass if placed at the bottom will scarcely be well defended from the unusefull glareing light which in the day time comes from objects on all sides the flat speculum, at least not so well as by setting it at the side. And that an Artificer can scarcely polish the great concave so truly when perforated in the middle. For the metall neare that hole will be apt to weare away too fast as it doth neare the exterior limb. And though the hole may be made after tis polished, yet if the figure happen to be less true, or if afterwards the metall chance to tarnish, it must be polished again. As for the advantages propounded by Mr Gregory I see not why the first should be recconed for one, viz: That the distance EF groweth almost the one half less & therefore the errors of the concave CD are also diminished upon the plane F by one half. For how much those errors of the concave CD are increased or diminished is to be estimated by the prevarication of the rays not at the plane F but at the Focus of that concave CD. And there the errors in both cases will be alike, provided the speculum F be accurately plane, but if there be any irregularities in the figure of that speculum F they will cause errors so much greater in one case then in the other, as that speculum is remoter from the eye-glass, which in large Telescopes may be more then 15 or 20 times. The other advantage, viz: That his Tube will be little more then half the length of mine I should allow to be very considerable, if I thought that with equall art in the mechanism it could be made to doe the same effect. The greatest difficulty is in forming the great Concave, which when once well done, perhaps it may be thought most advantageous to make the best use of it though with a longer Tube. The propounded supposed advantage of Telescopes with convex or concave speculums in that they may have any desirable charge by altering the distances of the eye-glass & specula, agrees more conveniently to my design of the instrument if that speculum be made use of which I described in a letter to Mr Oldenburg in answer to Monsieur Auzouts considerations on these instruments, which possibly you may have seen. For instance to double the charge the eye-glass in the other way must be drawn out almost as far behind the great concave as the little speculum is before it, whereby the length of the Tube will be almost doubled whereas in my way it need be drawn out no farther from the side of the Tube then a quarter of the Tubes diameter. The charge may be also conveniently varied by having two or three eye-glasses of severall depths set in a girdle, any of which may be adjusted to the metall F by sliding that girdle about the Tube or by sliding the ring within the Tube to which that girdle metall F is fastened. That Telescopes by convex or concave speculums should be overcharged is not necessary but yet it is not avoydable without running upon one of the other two inconveniences described in the 7th particular of my considerations on M. Cassegrains Tube, as I there intimated. 29. To diminish some of the afforesaid disadvantages there may be other still new variations or additions to these designes. As for instance by using two eye-glasses. Suppose CD represent the great Concave, F the little speculum E the eye-glass & G another double-convex glass between E & F on both sides of which the rays cross. This way of redoubling these Tubes seems not inferior to the rest. For thus the object appeares erect, the speculum F intercepts less light, & the charge may be varied at pleasure onely by changing the positions of G & F. But yet this is not without its imperfections, & particularly the (besides those common with the other Designes) the glass G will intercept many of the best rays in their passage from the concave CD to the little speculum F, unless it be made less then is consistent with some other conveniences. And by the iterated decussations of the rays objects will be rendered less distinct, as is manifest in Dioptrick Telescopes where two or three eye-glasses are applyed to erect the object. As to the attempt in which Mr Rieve was imployed, I presumed it had been done with much more accurateness then Mr Gregory now signifys, because Mr Hook, who you know is a curious & accurate experimenter, affirms in his considerations on my letter to Mr Oldenburg concerning refractions & colours published in the Transactions Number 80, that he made severall experiments with that Instrument. And though he lays the blame on Mr Rieve's encheiria, yet he says not that he blamed him then when the Experiment was made. His words are these "" I have made many tryalls both for Telescopes & Microscopes by reflexion which I have mentioned in my Micrographia, but deserted it as to Telescopes when I con sidered that the focus of a sphericall concave is not a point but a line, & that the rays are less true reflected to a point by a Concave then refracted by a Convex, which made me seek that by refraction which I found could not be ex pected from reflexion. Nor indeed could I find any effect of it by one of six foot radius which about 7 or 8 yeares since Mr Rieve made for Mr Gregory with which I made severall tryalls; but it now appeares that it was for want of a good encheiria; From which cause many good experiments have been lost. Both which considerations discouraged me from attempting further that way; especially since I found the Parabola much more difficult to describe then the Hyperbola or Ellipsis. From hence I might well infer that the want of a good encheiria appeared not till now. And that Mr Hook was discouraged from attempting further that way onely by these two or three considerations, That a Convex (as he presumes) refracts more truly then a concave reflects, that he found no effect by one of six foot radius, which till now he attributed to some other cause then the want of a good encheiria, as perhaps to the un namely to the supposedly less true reflexion of a sphæricall concave, & he supposed apprehended a greater difficulty of describing a Parabola then an Hyperbola or Ellipsis. Nor could I well interpret the cause from * * from which many good experiments have been lost to have been other then the want of a good encheiria which till afterwards appears not to have been wanting. I contend not that this was Mr Hooks meaning, but onely that his words seemed to import thus much, which gave me occasion to think there was no diligence wanting in making that experiment, especially since he expresseth that he made severall tryalls with it. And that you may not think I strained Mr Gregory's sense where he spake of Hyperbolick & Elliptick Glasses & Speculums attempted in vain; I would ask to what end those Speculums were attempted if not to compose optiqꝫue Instruments which is all I would infer from those words. For that those instruments if at all attempted were attempted in vain is evident by the want of success. This Sir I have said not that I desire to discourage the tryall of any practicable way or to contend with Mr Gregory about so slender a subject difference. For I doubt not but when he wrote his Optica promota he could have described more fashions then one of these Telescopes & perhaps have run through all the possible cases of them if he had then thought it worth his paines. Because M. Cassegrain propounded his supposed invention pompously, as if the main buisiniess was in the contrivance of these instruments I thought fit to signify that that was none of his contrivance, nor so advantageous as he imagined. And I have now sent you these further considerations on on Mr Gregory's answer onely to let you see that I chose the most easy & practicable way to make the first tryalls. Others may try other ways. Nor doe I think it materiall which way these instruments are perfected so they be perfected. You will pardon this long scribble in which I have been the more particular because Mr Gregory's discours looks as if intended for the Press. We are here very glad that we shall enjoy Dr Barrow again especially in the circumstances of a Master, nor doth any rejoyce at it more then Sir Your obliged humble Servant Newton. I suppose Slusius his method of Tangents will shortly appear abroad, when it comes over I'le beg of you the trouble of transmitting a coppy to me if you will give me leave to be accountable to you for it.

Extract of Mr Newtons Letter to M. Collins. Dec. 10. 1672. I am heartily glad at the acceptance, which D. Barrow's Lectures finds with forrein Mathematicians; and it pleas'ded me not a little to undderstand that they are falne into the same method of drawging Tangents with me. What I guess their method to be, you will apprehend by this example; Suppose CB applied to AB in any given angle be terminated at any Curve line AC, and calling AB x and BC y, let the relaontion betwt the between x and y be exprest by any æquaontion; as x3−2⁢x⁢x⁢y+b⁢x⁢x−b⁢b⁢x+b⁢y⁢y−y3=0, whereby the Curve is determin'ded. To draw the Tangent CD, the Rule is this. Multiply the termes of the æquation by any Arithmetical progression accordging to the dimensions of y, suppose thus x3−2⁢x⁢x⁢y+b⁢x⁢x−b⁢b⁢x+b⁢y⁢y−y3 010023; also accordging to the dimensions of x suppose thus x3−2⁢x⁢x⁢y+b⁢x⁢x−b⁢b⁢x+b⁢y⁢y−y3 322100. The first product shall be the Numerator, and the last divided by x the Denominator of a fraction which expresses the length of BD, to whose end D the tangent CD must be drawn. The length BC therefore is −2⁢x⁢x⁢y+2⁢b⁢y⁢y−3⁢y33⁢x⁢x−4⁢x⁢y+2⁢b⁢x−b⁢b. This is one particular, or rather a Corollary of a general Method which extends itself, without any troublesome calculaontion, not only to the drawing tangents to all Curve lines, whether Geometric, or Mechanic, or however related to streight lines or to other Curve lines, but also to the resolvging other abstruser kinds of problems about the crookedness, areas, lengths, centers of gravity of curves &c. Nor is it (as Huddens method de maximis et minimis, and conseqnquently Slusius his new method of Tangents, as I presume,) limited to æquaonstions which are free from surd quantities. This method I have interwoven with that other of working in æquaonstions by reducing them to infinit series. I remembber, I once occasionally told Dr Barrow, when he was about to publish his Lectures, that I had such a method of drawging Tangents, but some divertisemt or other hinder'ded me from describging it to him. Of resolvging by Cardans rules Æquaonstions that have 3 possible roots, there may be examples fram'ded at pleasure; but unless Brasser show a direct method of performing it, which Ferguson dos not, it will not be allow'ded scientific. How it is to be done directly, I may possibly show upon occaonsion. Mr Gregory is pleas'ded to c4344? Oldenb Copy43. Ex eadem epta Newtoni ad Colliniuum d. 10. Dec. 1672. Mr Gregory is pleased to consider further the most advantageous construction of Cata-dioptrical Telescopes. And as his dessein in his Optica promota excels that of M. Cassegrain (though they differ so slightly, that I thought it not worth the while to take notice of the difference,) the advantage being, that the litlelittle concave Ellipsis comscomes nearer to a Spherical figure, than the cConvex Hypperbola; so I conceive his present proposall excells them both, of making that speculuum plane. And this I conjecture is the way, which Signor Salvetti, one of the Great Dukes Musicians, mention'ded in the last Transactions, intends to make Exptxperiment of, excepting that instead of the Convex Ey-glas glass he may probably substitut a Concave one to erect the object. But yet I cannot think it the best, it being liable to the first, third and last of those difficulties, I urg'ded against M. Cassegrain, and in my Judgement not wholly capable of the advantages, which M. Gregory propounds. The first disadvantage was, that more light is lost in direct than oblique reflections. I am convinc'ded by several ObservaonstionsObservations, that reflexion is not made by the solid parts of a body, (as is commonly presum'ded,) but by the confine of the two mediums, whereof one is within, and the other without the body. And as stones are reflected by water, when thrown obliquely, which force their way into it when thrown directly downwards; so the rays of Light (whether Corporeal like stones, or not,) are most easily and copiously reflected when incident most obliquely. This you may observe in the passage of Light out of Glass into Air, which is reflected more and more copiously, as the obliquity is increas'ded, untill beyond a certain degree of obliquity it be wholly reflected. Also in the reflexion of Light by an imperfectly polish'tet plate of Brass or Silver or any other metall, you may observe that the Images of objects, which by direct reflexion appear dull and confus'ded, appear by very oblique reflexion pretty distinct and vigorous. This advantage of oblique reflexion would be inconsiderable, if metall reflected almost all the light directly incident on it, but so far as I can observe, there is at least a third part, if not the better half, of the light lost and stifled in the metal at every reflexion; and it is of some estimaontion if a third or fourth part of that can be redeem'ded by setting the flat speculuum obliquely. As for Mr Gregory's insinuaontion, that direct rays have the advantage of oblique, because a direct ball is reflected more regularly from a rough wall, than an oblique one; if he please to consider, how different are the causes and circumstances of those reflexions, possibly upon second thoughts he may apprehend, why the contrary ought to happen in Light, at least the Experiment of the rudely polish'tet plate of metall may persuade him. The next dis-advantage arising from the distance of the litle speculuum from the Ey-glass, being allow'ded, I pass to the last, which is to this effect; That; if to diminish the magnifying virtue of the instrument the litle speculuum be made of a larger sphere, (as it is in M. Gregory's dessein, a plane being equivalent to a sphere whose center is indefinitly distant,) that would cause too many of the best rays to be intercepted. And tho in his designe scarce a forth part of the whole light be intercepted, yet those rays seem to me of more value than twice their number next the circumference of the; Tube, because they principally conduce to distinct vision. Their loss will be judged considerable by those, that have thought the loss of scarce the fortieth part of the Light in my way worthy of being objected by reason that they were the best of the rays. There are yet other Consideraonstions, by which Mr Gregory's Tube may perhaps be thought less advantagious, as, that unles the speculuum F be made so broad as to intercept more than a quarter, or perhaps than a third part of the whole Light, it will be difficult to enlarge the aperture as is requisite for viewing dull and obscure objects. That the Ey-glas, if placed at the bottom, will scarcely be well defended from the unusefull glaring light which in the day-time comes from objects on all sides the flat speculuum, at least not so well as by setting it at the side: And that an Artificer can scarcely polish the great Concave so truly when perforated in the midle; for the metal near that hole will be apt to weare away too fast, as it doth near the exterior limb. And tho the hole may be made after 'tisit is polish'tet, yet if the figure happen to be less true, or if afterwards the metal chance to tarnish, it must be polish'tet again. As for the Advantages propounded by M. Gregory, I see not, why the first should be reckon'ded for one, viz. That the distance EF grows almost the one half less, and therefore the Errors of the Concave CD are also diminish'tet upon the plane F by one half. For, how much those Errors of the Concave CD are increas'ded or diminish'ded is to be estimated by the prevarication of the rays not at the plane F, but at the focus of that concave CD. And there the Errors in both cases will be alike, provided the speculuum F be accurately plane; but if there be any irregularities in the figure of that Speculuum F, they will cause Errors so much greater in one case than in the other, as that speculuum is remoter from the Ey-glass; which in large Telescopes may be more than 15 or 20 times. The other Advantage, viz. That his Tube will be litle more than half the length of mine, I should allow to be very considerable, if I thought, that with equall art in the mechanisme it could be made to doe the same effect. The greatest difficulty is in forming the great Concave, which when once well done, perhaps it may be thought most advantagious, to make the best use of it with a longer Tube. The suppos'ded Advantage of Telescopes with Convex or Concave speculums in that they may have any desirable charge by altering the distances of the Ey-glass and specula, agrees more conveniontly with my42? Oldenburg Copy42. dessein of the Instrument if that speculuum be made use of, which I described in a letter to M. Oldenburg in answer to M. Auzouts Considerations on these Instrum'tsents, which possibly you may have seen. For instance, to double the charge, the Ey-glass in the other way must be drawn out almost as far behind the great concave as the litle speculuum is before it, whereby the length of the Tube will be almost doubled; whereas in my way it need be drawn out no farther from the side of the Tube than a quarter of the Tube's diameter. The charge may be also conveniently varied by having 2 or 3 Ey-glasses of severall depths set in a girdle; any of which may be adjusted to the metal F, by sliding that girdle about the Tube or by sliding the ring within the Tube, to which that metal F is fastned. That Telescopes by Convex or concave speculums should be overcharg'ded is not necessary; but yet it is not avoidable without running upon one of the other two inconveniences, described in the seventh particular of my consideraonstions on M. Cassegrains Tube, as I there intimated. To diminish some of the aforesaid disadvantages, there may be still new variaonstions or additions to these designes. As, for instance, by using two Ey-glasses. Suppose CD represent the great Concave, F the litle Speculuum, E the Ey-glas and G another double Convex-glas between E and F between E and F, on both sides of which the rays crosse. This way of redoubling the these Tubes seems not inferior to the rest: for, thus the object appears erect, the speculuum F intercepts less light, and the charge may be varied at pleasure, only by changing the positions of G and F. But yet this is not without its imperfections, and particularly (besides those common with the other designs,) the glass G will intercept many of the best rays in their passage from the Concave CD to the litle speculuum F, unless it be made less than is consistent with some other conveniences. And by the iterated decussations of the rays, objects will be rendred less distinct, as is manifest in Dioptric Telescopes, where 2 or 3 Ey-glasses are applyed to erect the object. As to the attempt in which Mr Reeves was imployed, I presum'ded, it had been done with much more accuratness than Mr Gregory now signifyes, because Mr Hook, who you know is a curious and accurate Expperimenter, affirms in his consideraonstions on my letter to M. Oldenburg concerning refractions & colors, pu publish'tet in the Transactions No 80, that he made several Experiments with that Instrument. And though he lays the blame on M. Reeve's Encheiria, yet he says not, that he blam'ded him then; when the Experiment was made. His words are these; ""I have made many tryals both for Telescopes and Microscopes by reflexion, which I have mention'ded in my Micrography, but deserted it as to Telescopes, when I considered, that then focus of a spherical Concave is not a point but a line, and that then rays are lesse true reflected to a point by a Concave, than refracted by a Convex; which made me seek that by refraction, which I found could not be expected by reflexion. Nor indeed could I find any effect of it by one of six foot radius which about 7 or 8 years since Mr Reeve made for M. Gregory, with which I made severall tryals; but it now appears, that it was for want of a good encheiria; from which cause many good Experiments have been lost. Both which consideraonstions discourag'ded me from attempting further that way, especially since I found the Parabola much more difficult to describe, than the Hypperbola or Ellipsis."" From hence I might well infer that the want of a good Encheiria appear'ded not till now: And that Mr Hook was discouraged from attempting further that way only by these 2 or 3 consideraonstions; That a Convex (as he presumes) refracts more truly, than a concave reflects; that he found no effect by one of 6 foot radius, which till now he attributed to some other cause then the want of a good encheiria, namly to the supposedly less true reflexion of a spherical concave; and that he apprehended a greater difficulty of describing a parabola than an Hyperbola or Ellipsis. Nor could I well interpret the cause, from which many good Experiments have been lost, to have been other than the want of a good Encheiria, which till afterwards appears not to have been wanting. I contend not, that this was M. Hooks meaning, but only that his words seem'ded to import thus much: which gave me occasion to think, there was no diligence wanting in making that Experiment, especially since he expresseth, that he made severall tryals with it. Newton? Sept. 23. 72. And that you may not think I strain'ded Mr Gregorys sense, where he spake of Hyperbolic and Elliptic Glasses and Speculums attempted in vain; I would aske, to what end those Speculums were attempted in va if not to compose optic Instruments; which is all I would inferr from those words. For, that these Instruments, if at all attempted, were attempted in vain, is evident by the want of success. This, Sir, I have said, not that I desire to discourage the tryall of any practicable way, or to contend with Mr Gregory about so slender a difference. For, I doubt not but when he wrote his Optica promota, he could have described more fashions than one of these Telescopes and perhaps have run through all the possible cases of them, if he had thought it worth his pains. Because M. Cassegrain propounded his suppos'ded Invention pompously, as if the main busines was in the contrivance of these Instruments, I thought fit to signify, that that was none of his contrivance, nor so advantageous as he imagin'ded. And I have now sent you these further Consideraonstions on M. Gregory's Answer, only to let you see, that I chose the most easy and practicable way to make the first Tryals. Others may try other ways. Nor doe I think it material, which way these Instruments are perfected, so they be perfected.",NATP00314,1672-12-10 00:00:00

225,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Letter from Newton (probably to Henry Oldenburg), dated 3 April 1673",MS Add. 9597/2/18/31-32,3 April 1673,England,"['English', 'Latin', 'French']","31 Mr Newtons Answer to Monsieur Hugenius's Letter of Jan. 14. 167273. Philosophical Transactions N. 97. p. 6108. It seems to me that M. Hugens takes an less convenient improper way of examining the nature of colours whilst he proceeds upon compounding those that are already compounded, as he doth in the former part of his animade letter. Perhaps he would sooner satisfy himself by resolving light into colours as far as may be done by Art, and then by examining the properties of those colours apart, and afterwards by trying the effects of reconjoyning two or more or all of those, & lastly by separating them again to examin what changes that reconjunction had wrought in them. This will prove a tedious & difficult task to do it as it ought to be done but I could not be satisfied till I had gone through it. However lonely propound it, and leave every man to his own method. As to the contents of his letter I conceive my former answer to the Quære about the number of colours is sufficient, which was tho this effect, that all colours cannot practically be derived out of Ble Yellow & Blew, & consequently that those Hypotheses are fals which imply they may. If you ask what colours cannot be derived out of Yellow & Blew, I answer none of those which I defined to be originall and if he can show by experiment how they may I will acknowledg my self in an error. Red, yellow, green, blew, violet, purple, together with orange, indigo and an indefinite variety of intermediate gradations Nor is it easier to frame an Hypothesis by assuming onely two originall colours rather then an indefinite variety, unless it be easier to suppose that there are but two figures sizes & degrees of velocity or force of the æthereal corpuscles or pulses rather then an indefinite variety, which certainly would be a very harsh supposition. No man wonders at the indefinite variety of waves of the sea or of sands on the Shore, but were they all of but two sizes it would be a very puzzeling phænomenon. And I should think it as unaccountable if the severall parts or corpuscles of which a shining body consists, which must be supposed of various figures sizes and motions, should impress but two sorts of motion on the adjacent æthereall Medium, or any other way beget but two sorts of rays. But to examin how colours may be thus explained Hypothetically is besides my purpose. I never intended to show wherein consists the nature and difference of colours, but onely to show that de facto they are originall & immutable qualities of the rays which exhibit them, & to leave it to others to explicate by Mechanicall Hypotheses or otherwise, the nature & difference of those qualities; which I take to be no very difficult matter. But I would not be understood as if their difference consisted in the different refrangibility of those rays. For that different refrangibility conduces to their production no otherwise then by separating the rays whose qualities they are. Whence it is that the same rays colorays exhibit the same colours when separated by any other meanes; as by their different reflexibility; a quality not yet discoursed of. In the next particular where M. Hugens would show that it is not necessary to mix all colours for the production of white, the mixture of yellow green & blew, without red & violet, which he propounds for that end, will not produce white but green, & the brightest part of the yellow will afford us no other colour but yellow, if the experiment be made in a room well darkened, as it ought, because the coloured light is much weakened by the reflexion, & so apt to be diluted by the mixing of any other scattering light. But yet there is an experiment or two mentioned in my letter in the Transactions Number 88 by which I have produced white out of two colours alone and that variously, as out of Orang and a full Blew, and out of Red & pale blew, & out of yellow & violet, as also out of other paires of intermediate colours. The most convenient experiment for performing this was that of casting the colours of one Prism upon those of another after a due manner. But what M. Hugens can deduce from hence I see not. For the two colours were compounded of all others, & so the resulting white to speake properly was compounded of them all & onely decompounded of those two. For instance, the Orange was compounded of Red, Orang, Yellow & some Green, & the Blew of Violet, full bBlew, light Blew & some Green, with all their intermediate degrees; & consequently the Orang & Blew together made an aggregate of all colours to constitute the white. Thus if one mix red, orang, & yellow pouders to make an Orang; & green, blew & violet pouders to make a Blew, & lastly the two mixtures to make a Grey, that Grey though decompounded of no more then two mixtures is yet compounded of all the six pouders as truly as if the pouders had been all mixed at once. This is so plain that I conceive there can be no further scruple especially to them who know how to examin whether a colour be simple or compounded & of what colours it is compounded: which having explained in another place, I need not now repeat. If therefore M. Hugens, would conclude any thing, he must show how white may be produced out of two uncompounded colours; which when he hath done, I will further tell him why he can conclude nothing from that. But I believe there cannot be found an experiment of that kind, because as I remember I once tryed by graduall succession the mixture of all paires of uncompounded colours, & though some of them were paler & nearer to white then others yet none could be truly called white. But it being some yeares since this tryall was made, I remember not well the circumstances, & therefore recommend it to others to be tryed again. Meane time since M. Hugens seems to allow that white is a composition of two colours at least if not of more; give me leave to rejoyn these Quæres. 1. Whether the whiteness of the suns light be compounded of the like colours? 2. Whether the colours that emerg by refracting that light be those component colours separated by the different refrangibility of the rays in which they inhere? In the last place, had I thought the distitinctness of the picture which (for instance) a twelve foot Object-glass casts into a darkened Room, to be so contrary to me as M. Hugens is pleased to affirm, I should have mended my Theory in that point before I propounded it. no 80. p. 3079. For that I had thought on that difficulty you may easily guess by an expression somewhere in my first letter to this purpose that I wondered how Telescopes could be brought to so great perfection by refractions which were so irregular. But to take away the difficulty I must acquaint you, first, That though I put the greatest laterall error of the rays from one another to be about 150 of the glasses diameter, yet their greatest error from the points, on which they ought to fall, will be but 1100 of that diameter: And then, that the rays, whose error is so great, are but very few in comparison to those which are refracted more justly. For the rays which fall upon the middle parts of the glass are refracted with sufficient exactness, as also are those that fall neare the perimeter & have a mean degree of refrangibility. So that there remain onely the rays which fall neare the perimeter & are most or least refrangible to cause any sensible 32. sensible confusion in the picture. And these are yet so much further weakened by the greater space through which they are scattered, that the light which falls on the due point is infinitely more dense then that which falls on any other point round about it. Which though at first it may seem a Paradox yet is easily demonstrable. Yea although the light which passeth through the middle parts of the glass were wholly intercepted yet would the remaining light convene with infinitely more dense at the due points then at other platces through which it is scattered. And by this excess of density, the light which falls in or insensibly neare the just point, may I conceive, strike the sensorium so vigorously that the impress of the weak light which errs round about it, shall in comparison not be strong enough to be animadverted, or to cause any more sensible confusion in the picture then is found by experience. This I conceive is enough to show why the picture appeares so distinct notwithstanding the irregular refraction. But if this satisfy not, M. Hugens may try if he please how distinct the picture will appear when all the Lens is covered excepting a little hole next its edg on one side onely. And if in this case he please to measure the breadth of the colours thus made at the edg of the suns picture, he will perhaps find it approach nearer to my proportion then he expects. Cambridg.

226,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Letter from Newton to John Collins, dated 9 April 1673",MS Add. 9597/2/18/33-34,9 April 1673,England,"['English', 'Latin', 'French']","33 Sir Havinge perused Mr Gregories candid reply, I have thought good to send you these further considerations upon the differences that still are between us. And first that a well polished plate reflects at the obliquity of 45 degrees more truly then direct ones seems to me very certaine. For the flat tuberculæ or shallow valleys, such as may be the remains of scratches almost worne out will cause the least errors in the obliquest rays which fall on all sides the hill, excepting on the middle of the foreside & bacside of it, that is where the hill inclines directly towards or directly from the ray: For if the ray fall on that section of the hill, it's error is in all obliquities just double to the hill's declivity: but if it fall on any other part of the hill its error is less then double, if it be an oblique ray. & that so much the lesse, by how much the ray is obliquer; but if it be a direct ray its error is just double to the declivity & therefore greater in that case. I presume Mr Gregory, if you think it convenient to transmit this to him, will easily apprehend me. How the charge may be varied at pleasure in my Telescope will appeare by this figure, where A represents the great concave, E the eye-glass, & BCD a Prism of glass or Crystall whose sides BC & BD are not flat but spherically convex, so that the rays which come from G the focus of the great concave A, may by the refraction of the first side BC be reduced into parallelism, & after reflexction from the base CD be made by the refraction of the next side BD to converge to the focus of the eyeglass H. The Telescope being thus formed it appears how the charge may be altered by varying the distances of the glasses & speculum. As for the objection that Mr Gregorie's Telescope will be either overcharged or have too small an vision angle of vision &c; I apprehend that the difference betweene us lies in limiting the aperture of the eye-glass. Mr Gregory puts it equall to that of the little concave, but I should rather determin it by this proportion: That if a middle point be taken between the eye-glass & its focus, the apertures of the eye-glasse & concave be proportionall to their distances from that point. That is suppose AB the little concave, EF the eye-glass, GH their common focus or image, & K the meane distance between GH & EF, from the extremities of AB draw AK & BK butting on the eye-glass at F & E, & EF shall be its aperture. The reason of this limitation is that the superfluous light which comes on all sides of the speculum AB to the space GH in which the picture of the object is made, may fall besides the eye-glass. For if it should passe through it to the eye, it would exceedingly blend those parts of the picture with which tis mixed, and such are those parts of it which extend themselves beyond the lines AK, BK. As I remember I said in my former letter that the scattering light which falls on the eye-glasse will disturb the vision & this is to be understood of any straggling light which comes not from the picture, but if it come from the picture to the eye-glasse the disturbance will be much greater so as not to be allowed of. Against the first I see no very convenient remedy & against the last none but assigning a small aperture to the eye-glasse; supposing the Telescope is used in the day-time or in twy-light or to view the Moon or any Starr very neare her or near the brighter planets. And if for this reason the aperture be be limitted by my rule, the angle of vision will become very small as I affirmed; For instance in that case where Mr Gregory in his Postscript puts it above 20 degrees it will be reduced to lesse then halfe a degree. Yet I confesse there is a way by which the angle of vision may be somthing inlarged but it will not be very considerably unless the eye-glass be also deeper charged. Why I assign a concave with an eye-glasse to magnifie small objects (in Transactions pag. 3080) & yet an eye-glass without such a concave to magnify the image of the great concave which is equivalent to a small object, is because that image doth not require to be magnified so much as an object by a Microscope, & further because the angle of the penicill of rays which flow from any point of the small object, that the object may appear sufficiently luminous, ought to be as great as possible; and a Concave will with equall distinctness reflect the rays at a greater angle of the penicill then a lens: but in the Telescope the angles of those penicills are not so great as to transcend the limits at which an eye-glass may with sufficient distinctness refract them, and therefore in these instruments I chose to lay all the stress of magnifying upon the eye-glasses. In Microscopes also I would lay as much stress of magnifying upon the eye-glass as it is well capable of, and the excesse only upon the concave. ConcerningeConcering my citation of Mr Gregory against Monsieur Cassegrain the force of it lies onely in the inference that Optiq instruments most probably accordingeaccording to M. Cassegrains design have been tryed by reflexion; which I think I might well infer, without having regard to the specified figure of the speculum which Mr Gregory there spake of. And therefore I think it cannot be said that I magdet made him speake of Spherick figures where his meaning was of Hyperbolick & Elliptick ones. But if I should be so understood because I put the figure of the great concave to be sphericall wherever I specify it, I know not why I might not by way of consequence make that interpretation. For it is not probable that any man would attempt HyperbolickeHyperbolick & Elliptick figures of speculums untill the event of Sphericall ones had beene first tryed. 34. And accordingly the tryall of Mr Gregory with Mr Reive was by a sphericall figure. Which tryall although I am now satisfyed that it was made very rudely yet by the information which I had of it when I wrote the letter about M. Cassegrains design, I apprehended it to have beene made with very great diligence & curiosity as I signified in my former letter at large. And this I hope may excuse me for speaking of it in the Transactions as if it had beene tryed with more accuracy then really it was. And thus much concerning the Telescope. The design of the burningeburning speculum appears to me very plausible & worthy of beinge put in practise: What Artists may think of it I know not but the greatest difficultie in the practise that occurrs to me is to proportion the two surfaces so, that the force of both may be in the same point accordingeaccording to the Theory. But perhaps it is not necessary to be so curious, for it seems to me that the effect would scarce be sensibly less if both sides should be ground to the concave & gage of the same tool. I suppose you have receiv'd a letter from me sent last weeke to signify my receipt of the books you sent in Queeres &c. It comes now into my mind that when I sent Mr Pitts 4łł for Kinkhuysen he further urged a promise of some copies.

Boss, That he takes twotoo much paines in demonstrating many things which, of themselves are sufficiently obvious especially to one a little versed in Euclide. That his reprehensions of M. Boss are usually groundless & frivolous; as for instance, being sometimes for his omission of some lines in his draughts as if done out of ignorance, which yet a candid reader would rather think omitted least his shemesschemes should be cumbered with two great a multiplicity of lines, especially since the drawing of them might be deduced from his precepts. That his ways of designing without reguard to the point of distance is not preferrable to the other ways in which the point of distance is considered. That And that it is as convenient to make use of a scale as of those other ways which he would substitute in stead thereof. So that although this Author hath inriched Perspective with many new considerations yet those in practise will have little or no advantage above those which are already in use.

I committed it also to the perusall of another friend who out of curiosity desired it, but when he had looked upon two or three of his first propositions he became prejudiced by reason of some greater obscurity in them then in those with which M.

Hugens's Letter of June 10. 1673; in which Answer the he further explains his New Theory of Light and Colors, and particularly that of Whiteness, etc. Sir I received your letters with M. Hugens kind present, which I have viewed with great satisfaction, finding it full of very subtile & usefull speculations very worthy of the Author. I am glad that we are to expect another discours of the vis centrifuga, which speculation may prove of good use in naturall Philosophy & Astronomy as well as mechanicks. Thus for instance if the reason why the same side of the Moon is ever towards the earth be the greater conatus of the other side to recede from it; it will follow (upon supposition of the Earths motion about the Sun) that the greatest distance of the sun from the earth is to the greatest distance of the Moon from the earth, not greater then 100000 to 55912 10000 to 56 & therefore the parallax of the Sun not less then 5610000 of the Parallax of the Moon: Because were the sun's distance less in proportion to that of the Moon, she would have a greater conatus from the sun then from the earth. I thought also sometime that the moons libration might bdepend upon that her conatus from the Sun & Earth compared together, till I apprehended a better cause. In the Demonstration of the 8th Proposition, dDe descensu gravium, there seems to be an illegitimate supposition, namely that the flexures at B & C do not hinder the motion of the descending body. For in reality they will hinder it, so that a body which descends from A shall not acquire so great velocity when arrived to D as one which descends from E. If this supposition be made becaus a body descending by a curve line meets with no such opposition, & this Proposition is laid down in order to the contemplation of motion in curve lines: then it should have been shown that though rectilinear flexures do hinder, yet the infinitely little flexures which are in curves, though infinite in number, do not at all hinder the motion. The rectifying curve lines by that way which M. Hugens calls Evolution, I have been sometimes considering also, & have met with a way of resolving it which seems more ready & free from the trouble of calculatioon then that of M. Hugens. If he please I will send it him. The Problem also is capable of being improved by being propounded thus more generally. ""Curvas invenire quotascunqꝫue quarum longitudines cum propositæ alicujus Curvæ longitudine, vel cum area ejus ad datam lineam applicata, comparari possunt."" No 6086Pr. 4.Mr Newtons Answer to the foregoing letter further explaining his Theory of Light and Colors, and particularly that of Whitenes; together with his continued hopes of perfecting Telescopes by Reflections rather than Refractions. Concerning the bussiness of colours; in my saying that when M. Hugens Monsieur M. Hugens hath shown how White may be produced out of two uncompounded colours, I will tell him why he can conclude nothing from that; my meaning was, that such a White, (were there any such,) would have different properties from the White, which I had respect to, when I described my Theory, that is, from the white of the Sun's immediate light, of the ordinary objects of our senses, & of all white Phænomena that have hitherto faln under my observation. And those different properties would evince it to be of a different constitution: Insomuch that such a production of white would be so far from contradicting, that it would rather illustrate & confirm my Theory; because by the difference of that from other whites it would appear that other whites are not compounded of onely two colours like that. And therefore if M. Hugens Monsieur N. would prove any thing, it is requisite that he do not onely produce out of white two primitive N 6 8. 6.p. 6.n. 6.colours a white which to the naked eye shall appear like other whites, but also shall agree with them in all other properties. But to let you understand wherein such a white would differ from other whites & why from thence it would follow that other whites are otherwise compounded, I shall lay down this position That a compounded colour can be resolved into no more simple colours then those of which it is compounded. This seems to be self evident, & I have also tryed it severall ways, & particularly by this which follows: Let α represent an poblong piece of white paper about 12 or 14 of an inch broad & illuminated in a dark room with a mixture of two colours as little compounded cast upon it from two Prisms, suppose a deep blew & scarlet, which are must severally be as uncompounded as they can conveniently be made. Then at a convenient distance, suppose of six or eight yards, view it through a clear triangular glass or crystall Prism held parallel to the paper & you shall see the two colours parted from one another in the fashion of two images of the paper as they are represented at β & γ where suppose β the scarlet & γ the blew, without green or any other colour between them. Now from the afforesaid Position I deduce these two conclusions: 1 That if there were found out a way to compound white of two simple colours onely, that white would be again resolvable into no more then two. Secondly That if other whites (as that of the suns light &c) be resolvable into more then two simple colours (as I find by experiment that they are) then they must be compounded of more then two. To make this plainer, suppose that A represents a white body illuminated by a direct beam of the sun transmitted through a small hole into a dark room, & α such another body illuminated by a mixture of two simple colours which if possible N 67may make it also appear of a white colour exactly like A. Then at a convenient distance view these two whites through a Prism & A will be changed into a series of all colours, rRed, yYellow, gGreen, Blew, Purple with all their intermediate degrees succeeding in order from B to C. But α, according to the afforesaid experiment, will onely yeild those two colours of which it was compounded, & those not conterminate like the colours at BC but separate from one another, as at β & γ, by means of the different refrangibility of the rays to which they belong. And thus by comparing these two whites, they would appear to be of a different constitution & A to consist of more colours then α. So that what M. Hugens Monsieur N. contends for, would rather advance my Theory by the access of a new kind of white then conclude against it. But I see no hopes of compounding such a white. As for M. Hugens Monsieur N. his expression that I maintain my doctrine with some concern I confess it was a little ungratefull to me to meet with objections which had been answered before, without having the least reason given me why those answers were insufficient. The answers which I speak of are in the Transactions from pag 5093 to pag 5102. And particularly in pag 5095, to show that there are other simple colours besides blew & yellow, I instance in a simple or homogeneal green such as cannot be made by mixing blew & yellow or any other colours. And there also I show why, supposing that all colours might be produced out of two, yet it would not follow that those two are the onely originall colours. The reasons iIn desire you would compare with what hath 13. been now said of white. And so the necessity of all colours to produce white might have appeared by the experiment pag 5097 where I say that if any colour at the Lens be intercepted the whiteness (which is compounded of them all) will be changed into (the result of) the other colours. However, since there seems to have happened some misunderstanding between us, I shall indeavour to explain my self a little further in these things according to the following method. Definitions. 1. I call that Light homogeneal, similar or uniform whose rays are equally refrangible. 2. And that heterogeneal whose rays are unequally refrangible. Note. There are but three affections of light in which I have observed its rays to differ. viz: Refrangibility, Reflexibility & Colour, & those rays which agree in refrangibility agree also in the other two & therefore may well be defined homogeneal: especially since men usually call those things homogeneal which are so in all qualities that come under their knowledg, though in other qualities that their knowledg extends not to there may possibly be some heterogeneity. 3. Those colours I call simple, or homogeneal, which are exhibited by homogeneal light. 4. And those compound or heterogeneal which are exhibited by heterogeneal light. 5. Different colours I call not, onely the more eminent species, red, yellow, green, blew, purple, but all other gradations the minutest gradations: much after the same manner that not onely the more eminent degrees in musick but all the least gradations are esteemed different sounds. Propositions. 1. The Sun's light consists of rays differing by indefinite degrees of refrangibility. 2. Rays which differ in refrangibility, when parted from one another do proportionally differ in the colours which they exhibit. These two Propositions are matter of fact. 3. There are as many simple or homogeneal colours as degrees of refrangibility. For to every degree of refrangibility belongs a different colour by Proposition 2. And that colour is simple by Definition 1, & 3. 4. Whiteness such as is in all respects like that of the Sun's immediate light & of all the usuall objects of our senses cannot be compounded of two simple colours alone. For such a composition must be made by rays that have onely two degrees of refrangibility by Definition 1, & 3.; & therefore it cannot be like that of the suns light by Proposition 1; Nor for the same reason like that of ordinary white objects. Oooooo. 60915. That Whiteness in all respects like that of the Sun's immediate light may cannot be compounded of simple colours, there are requisite without an indefinite variety of them. For to such a composition there are requisite rays indued with all the indefinite degrees of refrangibility by Proposition 1. And those infer as many simple colours, by Definition 1 & 3. & Proposition 2 & 3. To make these a little plainer, I have added also the Propositions that follow. follow. 76. The rays of light do not act on one another in passing through the same Medium. This appeares by several passages in the Transactions pag. 5097, 5098, 5100, & 5101, & is capable of further proof. 7. The rays of light suffer not any change of their qualities from refraction. 8. Nor afterwards from the adjacent quiet Medium. These two Propositions are manifest de facto in homogeneal light, whose colour & refrangibility is not at all changeable either by refraction or by the contermination of a quiet Medium. And as for heterogeneal light, it is but an aggregate of severall sorts of homogeneal light no one sort of which suffers any more alteration then if it were alone becaus the rays act not on one another by Proposition 6. And therefore the aggregate can suffer none. These two Propositions also might be further proved apart by Experiments, too long to be here described. 9. There can no homogeneal colours be educed out of light by refraction which were not commixt in it before: Because by Proposition 7, & 8, Refraction changeth not the qualities of the rays, but onely separates those which have divers qualities, by means of their different Refrangibility. 10. The sun's light is an aggregate of an indefinite variety of homogeneal colours; by Proposition 1, 3, & 9. And hence it is, that I call homogeneal colours also primitive or original. And thus much concerning colours. M. Hugens Monsieur N. has thought fit to insinuate that the aberration of rays (by their different refrangibility) is not so considerable a disadvantage in glasses as I seemed to make be willing to make men beleive when I propounded concave mirrors as the onely hopes of perfecting Telescopes. But if he please to take his pen & compute the errors of a Glass & Speculum that N 6 P 2 6092collect rays at equall distances, he will find how much he is mistaken, & that I have not been extravagant, as he imagins, in preferring reflexions. And as for what he adds says of the difficulty of the praxis I know it is very difficult, & by those ways which he attempted it I beleive it next to an impossibility unpracticable. But there is a way insinuated in the Transactions pag. 3080 whereby by which it is not improbable but that as much may be done in large Telescopes, as I have thereby done in short ones, but yet not without more then ordinary diligence & curiosity. Pray with these Notes return my thanks to M. Hugens for his book. By a former letter of yours I was a little dubious whether M. Slusius might not apprehend, by what you wrote to him concerning me, that I pretended to his Method of drawing tangents; untill I understood by M. Collins that you signifyed to him that you thought it here of a later date. For it seems to me that he was acquainted with it some yeares before he printed his Mesolabum & consequently before I understood it. But if it had been otherwise yet since he first imparted it to the worl his friends & the world, it ought deservedly to be accounted his. As for the Methods they seem to be are the same, though I beleive derived from different principles. AndBut I know not whether his Principles afford it so generall as mine which extends to Equations affected with surd terms, without reducing them to another form. But if you please let this pass. The incongruities you speak of, I pass by. But I must, as formerly, signify to you that I intend to be no further sollicitous about matters of Philosophy. And therefore I hope you will not take it ill if you find me ever refusingrefraining doing any thing more in that kind, or rather that you will favour me in my determination by preventing so far as you can conveniently any objections or other philosophicall letters that may concern me. For your profer about the my Quarterly payments I thank you. But I would not have you trouble your self to get them excused if you have not done it already.

Sir I have here inclosed a Testimony of my judgment concerning Mr Dary his fitness for the place which he sues for, & I wish him all successe in it. The day after that I received your letter with one from him inclosed, I received another from him wherein he desires my opinion about the relation of the lines one to another which are drawn from the center of an Ellipsis to the angular points of a polygon inscribed into the same Ellipsis, which consists of 24 equall sides. As it appeares to me, their relation cannot be accurately known without an Equation which is 4 times decompounded of affected cubic equations & twice of quadratick ones, & by consequence would ascend to 324 dimensions: To compute which would be a Herculean labour, & when done, it would be unmanageable. I doubt therefore that to decide the controversy between him & Mr Gunton, recours must be had to some mechanicall examination of their assertions, but I leave it to you & Mr Bond to whome I understand it is referred. I must beg excuse that I have so long deferred to answer your letter wherein another from Mr Gregory was coveyedconveyed to me but now I understand that Mr Gregory is at London, & intends to make Cambridg in his way into Scotland, I shall not trouble you any further with discourses about the Perspective but refer it to our meeting, if Mr Gregory will be pleased to favour me with a visit.

Mr Andersons book is very ingenious, & may prove as usefull if his principles be true. But I suspect one of them, namely that the bullet moves in a Parabola. This would be so indeed were the horizontal celerity of the bullet uniform, but I should think its motion decays considerably in the flight. Suppose for instance a bullet shot horizontally moves from A moves in the line AE, & AI being perpendicular to the horizon in it take AF AG, AH, AI, &c in proportion as the square numbers 1, 4, 9, 16 &c: & its certain that if in one moment of time the bullet descend as low as F, in the next moment it shall descend as low as G, in the 3d as low as H &c. And therefore drawing the horizontall lines FB, GC, HD, IE; the bullet at the end of the first moment will be somewhere in the line FB suppose at B, & at the end of the 2d moment it will be somewhere in the line GC suppose at C &c. But that FB, GC, HD & IE are in Arithmeticall progression (which is the condition of the Parabola) seems not probable; for if it were so, the celerity of the bullet would increas becaus the spaces AB, BC, CD, DE described in equall times are the latter bigger than the former: whereas I should rather think that the celerity decreases very considerably. And perhaps this rule for its decreasing may pretty nearly approach the truth, viz: Letting fall the perpendiculars BK, CL, DM &c to make IK, KL, LM &c, a decreasing Geometricall progression. If you should have occasion to speak of this to the Author, I desire you would not mention me becaus I have no mind to concern my self further about it. As for the method of extracting the roots of literal equations, the root of this y3+a⁢a⁢y−b3=0 (which may be a form for all cubic equations) may be thus extracted. Suppose l pretty nearly equal to the desired root & put l in the quotient for the first term. Then proceed as follows. __________________________l−mn−3⁢l⁢m⁢mn3+m3n4 . . l+p=yy3l3+3⁢l⁢l⁢p+3⁢l⁢p⁢p+p3. +a⁢a⁢y+a2⁢l+a⁢a⁢p. −b3−b3. __________________________ For brevities sake I have putl3+a⁢a⁢l−b3=m &3⁢l⁢l+a⁢a=n. . −mn+q=pp3−m3n3+3⁢m⁢m⁢qn⁢n−3⁢m⁢q⁢qn+q3. +3⁢l⁢p⁢p+3⁢l⁢m⁢mn⁢n+6⁢l⁢mn⁢q+3⁢l⁢q⁢q. +n⁢p−m+n⁢q. +m+m. __________________________ . −3⁢l⁢m⁢mn3+r=qq3−27⁢l3⁢m6n9+27⁢l⁢l⁢m4n6⁢r−9⁢l⁢m⁢mn3⁢r⁢r+r3. −3⁢mn⁢q⁢q−27⁢l⁢l⁢m5n7+18⁢l⁢m3n4⁢r−3⁢mn⁢r⁢r +3⁢l⁢q⁢q+27⁢l3⁢m4n6−18⁢l⁢l⁢m⁢mn3⁢r+3⁢l⁢r⁢r +3⁢m⁢mn⁢n⁢q−9⁢l⁢m4n5+3⁢m⁢mn⁢n⁢r −6⁢l⁢mn⁢q+18⁢l⁢l⁢m3n4−6⁢l⁢mn⁢r +n⁢q−3⁢l⁢m⁢mn⁢n+n⁢r −m3n3−m3n3. +3⁢l⁢m⁢mn⁢n+3⁢l⁢m⁢mn⁢n. __________________________ There may be other ways of extracting the root of this equation: as for instance if b be greater then a, the root may be thus exprest y=b3−a⁢a3⁢b+a681⁢b5+a8243⁢b7&c. Or thus y=b3a⁢a−b9a8+3⁢b15a14−12⁢b21a20&c if a be considerably greater then b. The extraction of the simple cube root may be done after the same manner omitting only the 2d terme a⁢a⁢y. Or els it may be done as in the following example numerall Arithmetic. Suppose y3=a3+b3, & that a is bigger then b, & let the divisor for finding the terms of the Quotient be always tripple the square of the first term, that is 3⁢a⁢a. And the form of the work will be this. a3+b3a+b33⁢a⁢a−b69⁢a5+5⁢b981⁢a8&c a3 0+b3 00+ b3+b63⁢a3+b927⁢a6 0−b63⁢a3−b927⁢a6 00+00 −b63⁢a3−2⁢b99⁢a6∗+b1581⁢a12+b18729⁢a15 0−5⁢b927⁢a6∗−b1581⁢a12−b18729⁢a15 So if y3=c, suppose any letter as a to be pretty nearly equall to the cube root of c, & putting c−a3=b or a3+b=c extract the cube root out of a3+b as in the former example; which root viz:a+b33⁢a⁢a−b69⁢a5 +5⁢b981⁢a8&c being once extracted may be kept as a rule for extracting numeral cube roots. But yet (as you suggest) these infinite series are only usefull where the roots of equations cannot be attained accurately. For when they can be accurately attaind recours must be had to other methods, this only performing it by approximation. Sir I am Your obliged humble Servant Is. Newton Cambridge. June 20. 1674.

Tower the 15 of October 1674 Sir Although I sent you three papers yesterday, I Cannot refrain from sending you this: I have had fresh Thoughts this morning about those two sorts of Equations which wee have latly Bandied about, and I have attained an UnivesallUniversall series for any Equation of two Cossique notes. Truly it pleaseth me well. But yet I doe hereby submitt it to your Censure. To Extract the root of an Equation Consisting of Two severall powers (or potestates) and an absolute number; ꝑper an approximation easily performed by logarithmes. As for example +zp=a⁢zq,n In which example and in all such like Equations, you must observe that z is the unknown symbol or root sought, p= the index (or power note) of the highest power, a= the known number or Coefficient of the midle term, q= the index of the inferior power; n= the absolute number or resolvend. The rule is thus: First guess at the root as nearly as you can, the nearer the better (not for nescessitynecessity but for accomodatnaccomodation) and suppose that guess to be z. Then observing the following series, you shall approach (from this supposed z) toward the true z which is sought: Because every term in this series brings you nearer and nearer, for if your supposition be too great, every term in this series makes it less and less; or if your supposition be too litle, every term in this series makes it greater and greater. So when you are pleased to make a Ceasation, the last term is that which you seek. The series followes: :+a⁢zq+n:p=b :+a⁢bq+n:p=c :+a⁢cq+n:p=d. :+a⁢dq+n:p=e :+a⁢eq+n:p=f :+a⁢fq+n:p=g, &c: In which series you must note that + only intimates the retaining of the proper signes whether they be + or −.

And for the same reason I must desire to be excused from ingaging to exhibit yearly philosophic discourses, but yet cannot but acknowledge the honour done me by your Counsel to think of me for one amongst that list of illustrious persons who are willing to perform it, & therefore desire to have my thanks returned to them for the motion. If it were my lot to be in London for sometime, I might possibly take occasion to supply a vacant week or two with something by me, but that's not worth mentioning. If you think fit you may to prevent Francis Linus's slurring himself in print with his wide conjecture, direct him to the scheme in my second answer to P.

Vpon reviewing them I find somethingssome things so obscure as to need a further explication by figures, & some other things I guess will not be new to to you though almost all was new to me when I wrote them: but as they are I hope you will accept of them though not worth the ample thanks you sent. I remember in some discourse with Mr Hook I happend to say that I thought light was reflected not by the parts of glass water air or other sensible bodies, but by that same superficies of the æthereal Mediums which refracts it the rays that happen to break through it, the rays finding some difficulty to break through it in passing out of denser æther into rarer & a greater difficulty in passing out of the rarer into the denser, & so being either reflected or refracted by the superficies as the circumstances they happend to be in at their incidence make 'em unable or able to break through it. And for confirmation of this I added said further that I thought the refractflexion of the light at its tending out of glass into air would not be diminisht or weakend at its passing by drawing away the air in Mr Boyles an air Pump as it ought to be if they were the parts of the air that reflected it: ButAnd added that I had not tryed this experiment; but thought he was not unacquainted with notions of this kind. To which he replied that the notion was new & that he would the first opportunity try the experiment I propounded. But upon reviewing the papers I send you, I findound it there set down for tryed; which madkes me recollect that some years ago I had occasionally observed in an Air Pump here at Christs College that I could not perceive the reflexion of the inside of the glass diminished by drawing out the air. This I thought fit to mention least my former forgetfulness should seem to make me seem to have set down for certain what I had not never tryed. Sir I had formerly determined purposed never to write any Hypothesis of light & colours, fearing it might be a means to ingage me in vain disputes: but I hope I need not fear that if it proceed no further then to the ears of the Society. Considering therefore that such an Hypothesis will much illustrate the papers I send you; I shall not longer scruple to describe one so far as it may be done in this cursory letter: not concerning my self whether it shall be thought probable or improbable so it do but render the papers I send you more intellegible First then I suppose in this Hypothesis it is to be supposed that there is an æthereal Medium much of the same constitution with air but only far more rare more subtile & more strongly elastic: And of the existence of this Medium the motion of a pendulum in Mr Boyles a glass exhasted of air almost as quickly as in the open air is no inconsiderable arguments. .2. I suppose this æther a vibrating mMedium like air, only the vibrations far more swift & minute; those of air made by a man's ordinary voice succeeding one another at a foot distance mo more then a foot distance, but those of æther at a less distance then the hundred thousandth part of an inch. And as in air the vibrations are some larger then others, but yet all equally swift (for in a ring of bells the sound of every tone is heard at 3 or 4 miles distance, in the same order that the bells are stroke:) so I suppose the æthereal vibrations differ in bignes but not in swiftness. 3 As the air can pervade the bores of small glass pipes but yet not so easily as if they were wider, & therefore stands at greater degree of rarity then in the free aereal spaces, & at so much a greater degree of rarity as the pipe is smaller, as is known by the rising of water in such pipesto a much greater heighheight then the surface of the stagnating water into which they are dipt: so I suppose æther, though it pervades the pores of crystal, glass, water & other natural bodies, yet it stands at a greater degree of rarity in those pores then in the free æthereal spaces & at so much a greater degree of rarity as the pores of the body are smaller. And this I take to Whence it may be that  for instance though a lighter body yet having subtiler ꝑparts & consequently smaller pores then water is the more strongly refracting liquor. This also may be the principall cause of the cohesion of the parts of solids & fluids, & of the standing of the ☿ in the Torricellian experiment at a much greater height then 29 inches: For the denser æther which surrounds these bodies must croud & press their parts together much after the same manner that ytethe air surrounding two marbles presses them together if there be little or no air between them. 4 I suppose light is neither this æther not its vibrating motion, but something of a different kind propagated from lucid bodies, whether it be an aggregate of peripatetic qualities or of unimagiblyunimaginably small & swift corpuscles from luminous bodies at gtgreat distances from one another. or any other corporeal emanation, or some motion of the æther of a differing kind from its vibrations itf any such can be imagind proper for this purpose, or an impuls or motion of some other medium dispersed through the æther For the air, vapors – For the air, vapours, exhalations electric & magnetic effluvia are all instances that there may be other various mediums diffused through the æther. a corporeal emanation or an impuls or motion of some other medium dispersed through æther like the magnetic or electric effluvia, or some motion of the æther of a differing kind from its vibrations if any such can be imagin'd proper for this purpose, or a peripatetic quality. To avoyd dispute & make this HyposesisHypothesis general let every man here take his fancy. Only whatever itlight be I would suppose it consists of successive rays differing from one another in some accidental contingent circumstances, as bignes form or vigour; like as the sands on the shore the waves of the sea the faces of men & all other natural things of the same kind differ, it being almost impossible for any sort of things to be found without some contingent variety. And further I would suppose it divers from the æthereal vibrations becaus [5 As there is a certain tenacity in the superficies of water more then in the inwards parts of either water or air so that dust or even the filings of a metal which readily fall in either water or air will swim upon if thrown upon their common superficies: so I suppose there is a greater tenacity in the common superficies of a rarer & denser æther then in other places, so that the rays of light find some difficulty in passing through that superficies & are reflected or refracted or reflected accordingly as they can or cannot overcome thate difficulty. Yet this superficies I superficies I suppose to be not a mathematical one like that of water, but of some breadth, the æther therein being of all intermediate degrees of rarity between the rarer & denser Mediums. 6 When the rays impinge upon this superficies I suppose they cause vibrations in it as stones thrown into water do in its surface, & that these vibrations are propagated every way into both the rarer & denser Mediums as the vibrations of air which cause sound, are from a stroke but yet continue strongest where they began, & alternately contract & dilate the æther in that physical superficies: ♀ which superficies being thus continually agitated by vibration & the æther therein continually expanded & comprest by turns; if a ray of 476 light impinge upon it while it is much comprest, I suppose it is then too dense & stiffe to let the ray pass through & so it reflects it, but atthe otherays that impinge on it at other times, go through & are refracted. To explain this a little further you may consider how fluids when formed into thin shells or plates grow much more tenacious & tough then otherwise. Thus things which readily fall upon in water if let fall upon a bubble of water they do not so easily break through it as through the superficies of stagnating water , but are apt to slide down by the sides of it if they be not too bigg & heavy. So if two well polished convex glasses grownd on very large shpheres be laid one upon another, the air between them easily recedes till they almost touch but then begins to resist so much that the weight of the upper glasse is too little to bring together so as to make the black spot mentioned in these papers appeare in the middlst of the rings of colours; & if the glasses be plain though no broader then a two pence, a man with his whole strength is not able to press all the air out from between them so as to make 'em fully touch. You may observe also that Insects will walk upon water without wetting their feet, the thin skin or shell between their feet & the water bearing them up & so motes falling upon water will often lye long upon it without being wetted. And in like manner I suppose a ray in passing out of denser æther into rarer, when there remains between the ray of the rarer æther so little distance to be part through that the denser æther between them may be compared to a thin skin or shell, it finds much some difficulty to get through this skin: & this skin bein the æther where this skin is being alternately expanded & comprest by the continuall vibrations wherewith 'tis continually agitated, the skin is sometimes weakned by the expansion sometimes strengthend & stifned by the compression & accordingly reflects or transmits or reflects the ray. When a ray finds the refracting superficies so much condensed that it cannot get through, so soon as the ray has spent its force upon the superficies in endeavouring to pierce it, the superficies by its elasticity returns back upon the ray as a racket upon a tennis ball, all the force it received & so reflects it at an angle equal to that of incidence. But if the superficies at the arrival of the ray be in a state of expansion, or not so much condensed but that the ray can pierce it, then I suppose upon the rays departing into the next Medium the superficies acts upon the it & puts in adds more or less celerity to it according to the rarity of that Medium; for the rarer the medium is which the ray enters, the more easily does the ray yeild to the action of the superficies. To use a gross similitude you may conceive the action of the superficies upon the departing ray, to be something like that of a man's fingers darting a plumb-stone or other slippery body from between them by compressing it; for ] When a ray therefore moves through æther of uneaven density, I suppose it may be is most prest, urged or otherwise acted upon by the æther by the on that side towards the denser æther & receives a continual impulsor ply from that side to recede towards the rarer, & be so is accelerated if it move that way or is retarded if the contrary. On this ground if a ray move obliquely through such an uneavenly dense medium (that is obliquely to those imaginary superficies which run through the equally dens parts of ye medium of equal density & may be called the refracting superficies,) it must be incurved, as Mr Hook has it is found it to be by observation in water when lower parts were gradually made more salt & so more dense then the upper See his Mr Hooks Micrographia where he speaks of the inflexion of a ray. And this I take to may be the ground of all refraction & reflexion: for as the rarer air with a small glas pipe & the denser air without are not disterminated by a mathematical superficies but the air between at the orifice of the pipe runs through all intermediate degrees of density so I suppose the refracting superficies of æther between unequally dense Mediums to be not a mathematical one but of some breadth the æther therein being of all intermediate degrees of rarity between the rarer & denser æthereal mediums, & that refraction I conceive to proceed from the continual incurvation of the ray all the while it is passing this physical superficies. Now if the motion of the ray be supposed in this passage to be incurved or diminished in a certain proportion according to the difference of the densities of the æthereal mediums, & the addition or detraction of the motion be reccond in the perpendicular frōom the refracting superficies, the sines of of incidence & refraction will be proportional according to what Cartes has demonstrated. IfThe ray therefore in passing out of the rarer medium into the denser inclines continually more & more towards the refracting superficies & if the differing densities of the mediums be not so great nor the incidence of the ray so obli but that it as to make it ∥ to that superficies before it gets through, then it goes through & is refracted keeps its last inclination & is refracted, but if through the aforesaid causes the ray become ∥ to that superficies before it can get through, then it must turns back & isbe reflected. Thus for instance it may be observed that in a triangular glas prism OEF that ye rays AN that tend out of the refr. sup glass into air, do by inclining yen refracting superficies more & more to them, emerge more & more obliquely as at NL till they be infinitely oblique that is in a manner ∥ to the refracting suꝑperficissuperficies which happens when the angle of incidence is about 60 or 61 gr. & then if the refracting superficies they be a little more inclined the rays they become all reflected, as at Aνλ becoming I suppose ∥ to the superficies before they can get through it. For instance let ABCD represent the rarer Medium, EFHG the denser CDFE the space refracting physical superficies space between them inor which refracting physicall superficies in which the æther is of all intermediate degrees of density from the rarest æther at CD to the densest at EF. AIKL a ray, AIN itits incident part IK MN its incurvation by the refracting superficies, & KNL its emergent part. Now if the ray AM become so much incurved as to become at its emergence KN, as nearely as may be ∥ to the refrac CD or EF, its plain that if that ray had been incident a little more obliquely as is represented at Aμ it must have become parallel to CD before it had arrived at EF & so could never have got to the outside of the refracting superficies EF but must have turnd back & been reflected as it is represented at Aμνλ. And the like would have happend if the density of the æther had further increased from EF to PQ so that PQHG might be a denser medium then EFHG was supposed, for then the ray in passing from m to n being so much incurved as at n to become ∥ to CD or PQ, its impossible it should ever get nearer to PQ but must at N begin by further incurvation to turn back & so be reflected. *○ This may be the cause & manner of relexion when light passes out of tend from the rarer into toward the denser æther, but to know how it should be reflected when it tends out of from the denser into the rarer is more difficult to say; yet thus I explain it thus you are to consider how fluids neare their superficies are less pliant & yeilding then in their more inward parts, & if formed into a thin plate or shel they become much more stif & tenacious then otherwise. Thus things let fall –––– And so apply æ I suppose æther in the confine of two mediums is less pliant & yeilding then in other places & so much the less pliant by how much the mediums differ more in density: so that if a ray in passing through this cuticle & so great difficulty where the mediums are of very differing density as to be reflected by incurvation after the manner described above: the parts of the æther on that side where they are less pliant & yeilding acting upon the ray much after the manner that thay would do were they there denser on that side there then on the other side [whence if the superficies be not so unpliant but that the ray can get through it, yet the ray must first becom bent from the perpendicular incurved till it get to the most unpliant part of the superficies & in moving further through the less more pliant parts be unbent again & bent the contrary way by the greater density of the Medium the ray is moving out of.] And this I suppose may be the cause of the reflexion of Quicksilver & other metalline bodies. It must concur to increase the reflective virtue of the superficies when rays tend out of the dense rarer into the denser. And in that case therefore therefore the reflex the reflexion having a double cause 477 much; after the same manner as if all the glass between B & D were broken off at B the obtuse angle of the Diamond cut.

And hence I seem to gather that the rays in passing by the sides of the hair at a little distance are bent & those are most bent which pass by paribus) which pass by the hair at the leats distance. Let H represent the hair, aei, bfk, cgl, dhm four rays passing by the hair at several distances & bent in e, f, g, h & falling let them fall on the paper beyond the hair at i, k, l, m. And let nrw, osx, pty, qvz represent four other rays passing by the hair on the other side & bent in r, s, t, v & let them fall on the paper at w, x, y, z. And let mz be the shadow of the hair cast upon the paper. [ By this bending of the rays the shadow will become broader then it would be if they were not bent, [&] Produce the outmost rays dh & qu in right lines to A & B & the if those rays were not bent the hai in passing by the hair the breadth of the shadow of the hair upon the paper would not be greater then AB whereas by experrience its found considerably greater.] And if the rays which pass by the hair at the least distance be most bent as is represented in the figure the shadow will be broadest in proportion to the distance of the paper from the hair when the paper is nearest to the hair, But as is found true by experience. But if the outmost rays dh & qu were be not bent, produce them in right lines & let them fall on the paper at A, B & will be the breadth of the shadow will be AB which is less then it is found by experience if these rays are therefore bent tho not so much as the as the rays which pass by the hair at a less distance. So then the dark lines above mentioned which run bealong between the first and second fascias of either knife fringes of the shadows of either knife & meet in the middle of the light which passes between the knives at the distance of a fift part of an inch from the concourse of the edges of the knives, are in the passage betwe of the light between the knives distant from the edges of the knives the 320th part of an inch or there abouts. At another time when the two knives were distant eight feet & five inches from the little hole in the window made with a small pin as above, the dark line or shadow the point i where the dark line is & xip meet & cross one another between the first fringes of the shadows of either the two knives, fell upon a paper placed at the following distances from the knives when made at the distances between the edges of the knives were also as follows.

And hence I gather that the light which pass makes the fringes with the shadows between them passes by the edges of the knives at a less distance upon the paper is not the same light at all distances of the paper from the knives, but when the paper is held neare the knives the fringes are made by light which passes by the edges of the knives at a less distance & is more bent then when the paper is held at a greater distance. When I made these Observations I designed to repeat most of them with more care & exactiness & to make some others new ones for determining the manner how the rays of light are bent in their passage by bodies for making these fa fringes of colours with the dark lines between them:But but I was then interrupted & cannot now think of taking these things into further consideration. And since I have have not finished this part of my designe &I shall conclude with proposing only some Quæres in order to a further search to be made by others in these matters by others. [who may take these things into consideration] Quære 1. Do not Bodies act upon light at a distance & by their action bend its rays & is not this action strongest at the least distance. ☉ 1B. Are not &c ☉ 1B. Are not the rays of light in passing by the edges & sides of bodies bent several times backwards & forwards with a motion like that of an Eele. 2 Are not the rays more or less flexible accordingly as they are more or less refrangible, & are they with Do not the rays which differ in refrangibility differ also in flexibility& are they not by their different inflexions made at equall distances from the bodies are they not separated from one another so as by after separation to make the colours in the three fringes of colours above described. And after what manner are they inflected to make those fringes. 3 Do not the rays of light which fall upon bodies & are reflected or refracted begin to bend before they arive at the bodies, & are they not reflected refracted & inflected by one & the same Principle acting variously in various circumstances. 4 Do not light & bodies act mutually upon one another, that is to say bodies upon light in emitting reflecting refracting & inflecting it, & light make ally478ally upon bodies for heating them & pulling their parts into a vibrating motion wherein heat consists. And do not black bodies conceive heat more easily from light then those ‡‡ Ad 4. Ad Do not black bodies conceive heat more easily from light then those of other colours do by reason that the light falling on them is not reflected back but enters the bodies & is often reflected & refracted within them before it is shifted & lost. And is not the greatness or vigour of the action between light & sulphureous bodies observed above one reason why sulphureous bodies conceive heat & burn take fire more readily & burn more vehemently then other bodies do? 5 Do not all fixt bodies when heated beyond a certain degree emit light by the vibrating motion of their parts. 6 Is not fire a body heated so hot as to emit light copiously. For what else is a red hot iron or a red hot stone then fire & what else is a burning coale then red hot wood [whose heat is preserved by the actions of an acid spirit in the air acting upon & dissolving the wood. 7 Is not the flame a vapour fume or exhalation heated red hot that is so hot as to shine For bodies do not do not flame which do not emit a copious fume. 8 Are not the sun & fixt stars great earths vehemently hot whose heat is conserved by the mutuall action & reaction between them & the light which they emit & whose parts are kept from fuming away by the vast weight of the Atmospheres incumbent upon them. 9 Do not the rays of light in falling upon the Tunica retina bottom of the eye, excite vibrations in the Tunica retina which vibrations being propagated along the solid fibres of the Optick Nerves into the brain cause the sense of seeing. And are not the vibrations made by several sorts of rays * * For since dense bodies conserve their heat a long time & the densest bodies conserve their heat the longest, the vibrations of their parts are of a lasting nature & therefore may be propagated along solid fibres of uniform dense matter to a great distance for conveying into the brain the impressions made upon all the Organs of sense. For that motion which can continue long in & the same part of a body can be propagated a long way from one part to another supposing the body homogeneal so that the motion may not be reflected refracted & interrupted or disordered by the any uneavenness of the body. 10 Do And not several sorts of rays make vibrations of several bignesses, which according to their big several bignesses excite sensations of several colours much after the manner that several the vibrations of the air according to their several bignesses exite sensation of several sounds? And particularly do not the most refrangible rays excite the shortest vibrations for making a sensation of deep violet, the least refrangible the largest for making a sensation of deep red & the several intermediate sorts of rays vibrations of several intermediate bignesses to make sensations of the several intermediate colours? 11 May not the harmony & discord of colours arise from the proportions of the vibrations as the like propagated through the optic nerves into the brain and as the harmony & discord of sounds arises from the proportions of the vibrations of the air. For some colours are agreable as those colours of gold & Indigo & others disagree. 12 May Are not the species of objects seen with both eyes united when the Optick nerves meet before they come into the brain: For the fibres on the right side of both Nerves uniting there & after unison going thence into the brain in the nerve which is on the right side of the head & the fibres on the left side of both nerves uniting in the same place & after union going into the brain in the nerve which is on the left side of the head into the brain & these two nerves meeting again in the brain in such a manner thet their fibres make but one intire species half of which is on the right side of the sensorium & comes from the right side of both eyes & the other half of which on the left side of the sensorium comes from the left side of both eyes? For the optic nerves of such animals as look the same way with both eyes (as of Men, Doggs, Sheep, Oxen) meet before they go into the brain, but the Optic nerves of such animals as do not look the same way with both eyes (as of Fishes & the Chameleon) do not meet if I am rightly informed. 7B.Is not the 7B. Is not the greatness of the action between light & sulphureous bodies observed above, one reason why sulphureous bodies conceive heat & burn more readily & more vehemently then other bodies do. Obs.1. | Let X represent one end of the Hair, cut cross the adg, beh, cfi represent three rays passing by one side of the hair at several distances, & let d e & f kng, lor, mps three other rays passing by the hair at other side of the hair at the like distances; d, e, f & n, o, p the places where these"">these hairs rays are bent in their passage by the hair; g, h, i, q, r, s the places where these rays fall on paper si the breadth of the shadow where these rays of the hair cast on the paper And if the rays which pass by the hair at the least distances be most bent as represented in the figure By the bending of the rays the shadow becomes broader then it would otherwise be & if the rays which pass by the hair at the least distance be most bent the rays will as is represented in the figure the breadth of the shadow will be broadest increase most in proportion to the distance of the paper from the hair when the paper is nearest to the hair as is found by experiensce & Ai & Bs two rays passing to the points i & s without bending when the paper & not hair is taken away. And it is manifest that since all the light between the lines Ai & Bs is bent & turned asid in passing by the hair & turned aside from the shadow: for if any rays part of this light were not bent they it would fall on the paper within the space shadow si & destroy th there illuminate it & take away that part of the shadow where it falls which is contrary to experience. Bodies therefore act upon the light at a gre considerable distance in its passing by them; but the action is strongest on the rays which pass by at the leeast distances & grows weaker & weaker as light the rays on which they at accordingly as the rays pass by them at distances greater & greater, as is represented in the scheme For thence it comes to pass that the shadow of the hair is much broader is much broader in proportion to the distance of the paper from the hair is much broader when when the paper is at a dis neare the hair then when it is at a great distance from it. Ad Obs. 6. And hence the light of the in which is least bent & goes to the inward ends of the streams passes by the edges of the knives at the greatest distance, & this distance when the shadow begins to appear between the streams is is about the eight hundredth part of an inch. And the light which passes by the edges of the knives at a distance distances still less & less distances is more & more bent & goes to those parts of the streams which are further & further from the direct light, [because as the knives approach one another till they touch, the light at the inward ends of the streams vanishes more and more untill the who & the streams grow shorter & shorter at those ends untill they wholy disappear.] Ad Obs. 7. And hence the light of the first fringe passed by the edge of the knife at a distance greater then the eight hundreth part of an inch & the light of the second fringe passed by the edge of the knife at a greater distance then the light of the first fringe did, & that of the third at a greater distance479 Could all the phænomena of nature be [evidently] deduced from only thre or four general suppositions there might be great reason to allow the the reasonables of admit of allow the truth of those suppositions to be true: but if you where those for for explaining every new Phænomena you make a new Hypothesis if you suppose that the particles of water Air are of such a figure size & frame, those of water of such another figure those of Vinegre of some such another figure, those of sea salt of such another figure, those of nitre of such another, those of Vinegre Vitriol of such another, those of Quicksilver of such another, those of fire of flame of such another, those of Magnetick effluvia of such another, If you suppose that therays of light consists in such a motion pression or force, those & that those of several colours differ from one its various colours are made by such & such variations of the motion & so of other things: your Philosophy will systeme of Philosophy wi Philosophy will be nothing else then a systeme of a great number of uncertain Hypotheses. And what certainty can there be in a Philosophy which consists in as many Hypotheses as there are Phænomena & & explications of Phæ nomena to be explained. What ever To do To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. Tis much better to do a little with certainty then to & leave the rest for others that come after, then to explain all things by conjecture & leave without making sure of any thing. And there is no other way of doing any thing with certainty then by drawing conclusio drawing conclusions from experiments & phænomena untill you come at such general Principles as are & then from those Principles giving an account of Nature. This is the only Whatever is certain in Philosophy is owing to this method & nothing can be done without it. I will instance in some particulars. One principle in Philosophy is the being of a God or spirit infinite eternal omniscient, omnipotent, & the best argument for such a being is the frame of nature & chiefly the contrivance of the bodies of living creatures. All the great land animals have two eyes, in the forehead a nose between them a mouth under the nose, two ears on the sides of the head, two arms or t or two fore leggs or two wings on the sholders ,& two leggs behind & this symmetry in the several species could not proceed For from chance there being an equal chance for one eye or for three or four eyes as for two, & so of the other members Nothing is For Nothing is more curious & difficult then the frame of the eyes for seeing the & of the ears for hearing of wings for flying & & yet not an animal th a s a species no sort of creatures has these members witho to no purpose. What more difficult then to fly? & ye had flying creatures their wings by chance? or has any creature wings without being able to fly? & yet was it by chance that all creatures can fly which have wings? Certainly he that framed the eyes of all creatures understood the nature of light & vision he that framed their ears understood the nature of sounds & hearing, he that framed their noses understood the nature of odours & smelling, he that framed the wings of flying creatures & the fins of fishes understood the force of air & water & what members were requisite to enable creatures to fly & swim: & therefore the first formation of every species of creatures must be ascribed to an intelligent being such a being as we call God These & such like considerations are the most convincing arguments for such a being & have convinced mankind in all ages that the world & all the species of things therein were originally framed by his power & wisdom. And to lay aside this argument is very unphilosophical. Another Principle is that matter is impenitrable by other matter. This is usually looked upon as a maxim known to us by the light of nature, altho we know nothing of bodies but by sense. We find by dayly experience that bodies resist one another as often as they come together & cannot by any force be made toto penetrate one anothers dimensions. And this holding true without exception in all bodies here below in which we can come to make observations we conclude it to be the property of all bodies whatsoever. And such observations occurring every day to every man this property of bodies is acknowledged by all mankin men without any dispute & looked upon as an Axiom. A third property of bodies principle is is that all the great bodies in the Vniverse have a tendency towards one another proportional to the quantity of matter conteined in them & that this tendency in receding from the body decreases & is reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance from the body: [And all small bodies have the like tendency towards the great ones & this tendenc This tendency towards the earth we find in all bodies here below & call it gravity] This Such a tendency towards the earth we find in all bodies here below & call it gravity. & by experiments of the Pendulum & of falling bodies we find it exactly proportional to the quantity of matter in the several bodies We find it also in the Moon, the force which keeps her in her Orb being exactly reciprocally equal to the force of gravity.& recipro The like tendency towards the sun we find in all the Planets who are thereby kept proportiallproportionall to the square of her distance from the earth Iupiter we find in thehis four satellites proportial which are thereby kept in their Orbs about him & this tendency by comparing the Orbs & Revolutions of the Satellites together is proportional to the matter in the Satellites reciprocally as their squares of their distances from Iupiter. The like tendency to Saturn we find in this Sa five Satellites, proportional directly to their matter & in reciprocally to the squares of their distances. And all the Planets both primary & secondary & appear to have & some so many cComets as have been well observed appear to have the same tendency towards the Sun directly proportional directly to the matter in each of them & reciprocally to their distances from the sun. And by the rest or very small motion of the Aphelia of the the Planets it appears by that this tendency of all the Planets towards Iupiter Saturn & the Sun & of the Moon towards the earth decreases in receding The following mathematical fragment is written upside down. ADq,CFqEFq=CDq+MCqNGqCGq. CFq+EFqEFqADq=MCq×NGq+CGqNGq. ACq,ADqEFq=ACq×MCqNGq. A fourth Principle is that all sensible bodies are aggregated of particles laid together with many interstices or pores between them For water soaks into the pores of all animal & vegetable substances & some minerals & quicksilver into the pores of Metall & acid liquors into the pores of all minerals & metals in dissolving them, & light passes through the pores of aire, water oyles gla salt spars sand glass crystal gemms & all other pellucid substances & through the particles of all metals salts & minerals dissolved in pellucid menstruums or vitrified & through thin pieces of wood, flesh, bone horn stone & vitrified earth. As to the former Principle is As by the former third Principle we gave an account heretofore of the motions of all the Planets & of the flux & reflux of the sea, so by this Principle we shall give an acct in the following treatise give an acct of the permanent colours of natural bodies, nothing further being requisite for the production of those colours then that the coloured bodies abound with pelludcid particles of a certain size & density. This is to be understood of the largest particles or particles of the last composition. For as bodies are composed of these larger particles with larger pores between them so it is to be conceived that these larger particles are composed of smaller particles with smaller pores between them. And when water dissolves salts & acid menstruums or quicksilver dissolves metals it is to be conceived that the liquor enters only the larger pores & separates only the larger particles of the salt or metal from one another without soaking into the smaller particles 480 The text on this and the following page is written upside down.

For As Mathematicians have two Methods of doing things which they call cComposition and Resolution & in all difficulties have recourse to their method of resolution before they compound so in explaining the Phænomena of nature the like methods are to be used & he that expects success must resolve before he compounds. For the explications of Phænomena are Problems much harder then those in abstractio Mathematicks. The method of Resolution consists in trying experiments & considering all the Phænomena of nature from whence any thing can of nature relating to the subject in hand & drawing conclusions from them & examining the truth of those conclusions by new experiments & so proceeding drawing new conclusions (if it may be) from those experiments & so proceeding alternately from experiments to conclusions & from conclusions to experiments untill you have come to the general properties of things, And when you [& by experiments & phænomena have established the truth of those properties] Then assuming those properties as Principles of Philosophy you may proceed from by them explain the causes of such Phænomena as depend upon them & follow from them: which is the method of Composition. But, if you without deriving the properties of things from Phænomena you explain feign Hypotheses & think by them to explain all nature you may make a plausible systeme of Philosophy for getting your self a name, but your systeme being will be little better then a Philosophical Romance Romance. ‡ To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. Tis much better to do a little with certainty then to seem to no & leave the rest for others that come after you then to then to explain all things by conjecture without making sure of any thing. Thus in Mathematical Principles of Philosophy I first shewed from Phænomena that the all bodies endeavoured by a certain force proportional to their matter to approach ane another, that this force in receding from the body grows less & less in reciprocal proportion to the square of the distance from it & that it was is equal to gravity & therefore was is one & the same force with gravity. Then using this force as a Principle of gravity I shewed how Philosophy I derived from it all the Phænomena of nature motions of the heavenly bodies & the flux & reflux of the sea, shewing by mathematical demonstrations that this force alone was sufficient to produce all those Phænomena, & deriving from it (a priori) some new motions which Astronomers had not then observed but since appeare to be true, as that Saturn & Iupiter draw one another, that the Variation of the Moon is bigger in winter then in suppmmer, that there is an equation of the Moons meane motion amounting to almost 5 minutes . which depends upon the position of her Aphelium Apoge of the Sun. Seignr Rizzetti in the beginning of his paper writes thus. Newtonus cum lumini Solis in refraction objecisset Prisma triangulare, agravit spectrum Solis magis produce quam par lex vulgata refractionis postulasset: ideo lumen solis dispergi in refractione dispergi, ita ut unicus simplex radius in plures discindatur. Vnde apinatus est, id ipsum fore si lumen But Newton affirms no such thing. He affirms represents that every ray emitted from the Sun or other lucid body, continues one & the same without any dispersion or splitting by refraction or change in repect of refrangibility or colour. For in his first Definition, he calls the Rays of light its least parts, whether successive in the same lines or contemporary in several lines. And in his second Proposition he brings his 5t, 6t, 7th, 8th, 9th & 10th Experiments to prove that that one & the same ray is not split by refraction disturbed shattered, dilated split or spread into many rays. And his first Proposition is that homogeneal light is refracted regularly without any dilatation splitting or shattering of the Rays. He saith further that if the breadth of the of the image of a lucid point cast upon the bottom of the eye were about the 55th part of the bread of the pupill of the eye the hair of a mans head could not appear so distinct as it really doth; & then he adds. Cum dixerim in visione capilli locum minima esse aberratio ni Newtonianæ quia minime cernitur, adversus hujusmodi argumentum rationabilior mihi videretur objectio ducta a Propositione VII Autoris: nimirum adeo extenuari lumen aberrans in distantia a suo centro, Iut (loquar Newtoni verbis) non sit sensibile nisi in eodem centro aut prope illud. Vt objectioni respondeam, divisa semidiametro luminis aberrantis in undecim partes equales; ejus densitas juxta Newtonianam sententiam, decresit in talam Arithmeticam proportionem, ut cum expressa sit in prima parte a numero 21, exprimatur in secunda a numero 19, & sic deinceps, adeo ut in parte ultima exteriori exprimatur per unitatem. And yet Mr Newton affirms no such Arithmetical proportion. His Rule is that the density of the light at any distance from the center ais as the distance from the of that point from the circumference applied to its distance from the center. Let the semidiameter of the erring light be divided into eleven equal parts, & the density of the light in the midle of the part next the center will be to its density in the middle of the part next the circumference not as 221 to 1 but as 101212 to 121012 or as 441 to 1 He saith further. Vidit sapientissimus Anglus speciem solarem magis in longum porrectam quam lex vulgaris refractionis postulasset cum illam cerneret diversicolorem, scilicet rubram, mox flavam, deinde viridem, postea cæruleam, & tandem supra violaceam, hoc experimento fretus suum confecit systema luminis at colorum. Omnia experimenta, quibus illud innixum est, renovare curari, & ea (prologu id licet?) partim falsa, & omnia reliqua inveni propter omissionem ––– aliquam alicujus circumstantiæ æquivoca ac minime concludentia. Vt unicum [experimentum] allendas obsecro. Then he describes the experiment of the red & blue colours above recited with & tried before the Royal Society with success & of the red & blue colours as of the chart painted with red & blue colours of painting a chart with red & blue colours & casting the species thereof through a Lens upon which paper as is described above and denies as is described above which was lately shewed to the R. S. as is with success as is described above & denies the success. If it did not succeed with him it was because he did not know perfectly well as is described above. He should have told the world that Newton ground founded his Theory of light & colours upon the experiment which for its demonstrative evidence he calls experimentum crucis. This experiment he could not deny because it hath been tried again & again with full success both in France & in Italy with fo as well as in England: & therefore he passes it by in silence & denies the conclusion drawn from it, & contrary to the Rules481 Rules of Logic disputes against the conclusion without taking note of the Premisses.

151,Isaac Newton,Science,Draft of the 'Discourse Concerning Light and Colors',"MS Add. 3970.3, ff. 519r-529r",c. early 1675,England,['English'],"5179 Of the colours of plated transparent substances. Obs: 1. Compressing two Prisms hard together that their sides (which were a little convex) might somewhere touch one another, I found the place in which they touched to become absolutely transparent as if they had there been one continued peei of glasse. For when the light fell so obliquely on the Air which in other places was between them, as to be all reflected yet in that place of contact it was wholly transmitted. Insomuch that when looked upon it appeared like a black or dark spot by reason that no light was reflected from thence as from other places; & when looked through it seemed, as it were, a hole in the Air that was plated by formed into made a thin plate by being compres–sed sion between the glasses, & through which this hole objects that were beyond might be seen distinctly which could not aft all bee seen through other parts of the glasses where the Air was interjacent. Although the glasses were a little convex yet this transparent spot was of a considerable breatdth, which breadth seemed principally to proceed from the yeilding inwards of the parts of the glasses by reason of their mutuall pressure,. For by pressing the glasses very hard together it would become much broader then otherwise. Obs: 2. When the plate of Air by turning the Prisms about their common axis became so little inclined to the incident rays that some of them began to be transmitted, [& thereby to exhibit the blew bBow described in the second Experiment: as that Bow approached to the transparent spot] there arose in it many slender arcs of colours which at first were shaped almost like the Conchoid as you see them here delineated. And by continuing the motion of the Prisms these arcs increased & bended more & more about the said transparent spot till they were completed into semicircles or rings incompassing it, & then they continually grew more & more contracted. The parts of these circles at their first appearance [within the blew Bow] were of a vivid violet & blew, & between them were white arcs of circles which presently became a little tinged in their inward limbs with red & yellow, & to their outward limbs the blew was adjacent . So that the order of these colours from the centrall dark spot was at that time, White, Blew vViolet; dDarknesse; Red, Orange, Yellow, White, bBlew, Violet; &c. But the yellow & Red were much fainter then the Blew & Violet. T The motion of the Prisms about their axis being continued these Prisms colours contracted more & more shrinking towards the whitenesse on either side of it, & untill they totally vanished into it [so soon as the blew bBow was a little past them.] And then those circles parts of the circles in those parts appeared black and white without any other colours intermixed. But by further inclining the Prisms, the colours again emerged out of the whitenesse, the violet & blew at its inward limb & at its outward limb the red & yellow. So that now their order from the centrall spot was, white, yellow, red; black: violet, blew, white, yellow, red; &c contrary to what it was before. Obs: 3. When the circles or some parts of them appeared onely black & white, they were very distinct & well defined, & the blacknesse seemed as intense as that of the centrall spot. Also in the vicine places, where the colours began to emerge out of the whitenesse they were pretty distinct, which made them visible to a very great multitude. I have sometimes numbered abobe thirty successions (recconing every black & white circle for one succession) & seene more of them which by reason of their smallnesse I could not number. But in other positions of the Prisms when the circles became coloured I could not distinguish above 8 or 10 of them, & the exteriour of those too were very confused & diluted. In these two observations, to see the circles distinct, & without any other colour but black & white I found it very necessary that I held my eye at a good distance from them. For by approaching nearer, although in the same inclination of my eye, yet there emerged a blewish colour out of the white which by dilating it selfe more & more into the black rendered the circles lesse distinct, & left the white a little tinged with blew red & yellow. I found also that by looking through a slit or oblong hole which was narrower then the pupill of my eye & held close to it parallel to the Prisms, I could see the circles much distincter, & freer from colours & visible to a far greater number then otherwise. Obs. 4. To observe more nicely the orders of the colours which arose out of the white circles as the rays became lesse & lesse inclined to the plated Air; I layd the aforesaid Object gGlasses one upon the other, & pressing them slowly together to make the colours successively emerge in the middle of the circles, where being of a considerable breadth, I could more easily discerne them, I found their succession & quantity to be as followeth. Next to the pellucid ,centrall spot made by the contact of the glasses, succeded Violet, Blew, white, Yellow, & Red. The Violet & blew were so very little in quantity that I could not discerne them in the circles made by the Prisms, but the Yellow & Red were pretty copious & seemed about as much in extent as the white, & foure or five times as much more then the bBlew & Violet. The next circuit of colours immediately incompassing these was Violet Blew, Green, Yellow, & Red. And these were all of them copious excepting the green which was but very little in quantity & much more faint & dilute then the other colours. The third circuit was 51820 also pPurple, bBlew, gGreen, yYellow & Red; in which the Purple seemed a little more reddish then the Violet in the former circuit, & the Green was much more conspicuous, being as brisque & copious as any of the other colours except the yellow But the Red began to be a little faded inclining very much to purple. After these succeded a reddish Purple & with a little or no blew, & then followed Green which was far more very copious & far more lively then any other colour in this fourth circuit, but the Yellow & Red were very dilute, & the succeding colours became more & more diluted till after thre or four more revolutions they ended in perfect whitenesse. Obs: 5. By measuring the diameters of the first six circles & squaring them I found their squares to be in Arithmeticall Progression. Namely the thicknesse at the middle of the limb of the first white circle being supposed one part, the thicknesse at the yellowish green in the second circle was three of those parts, & at the yellowish green in the third circle it was five of those parts, & so on. I measured also the diameters of the dark or faint circles between the more lucid colours, & found their squares to be in arithmeticall progression of the eaven numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, &c. And it being very nice and difficult to take these measures exactly, I repeated them divers times at divers parts of the glasses, that by their agreement I might be confirmed in them. And the same method I used in determining the same some others of the following Observations. Obs: 6. The diameter of the sixt circles at its most lucid or yellow orbit was 58100 parts of an inch, & consequently the thicknesse of the Air or aAereall intervall of the Glasses at that yellow circle was 114554 of an inch, the eleventh part of which (1160094) is the thicknesse of thateir intervall at that part of the first circle where the yellow would be most vivid were it not mixed with other colours in the white. And this doubled gives the difference of their intervalls which are at the yellow in all the other circles viz 180047, or to use a round number, the eighty thousanth part of an inch. Obs: 7. These dimensions were taken when my eye was placed perpendicularly over the glasses in or neare the axis of the circles, but when I viewed them obliquely they became bigger continually swelling as I removed my eye further from their axis. And partly by measuring the diameter of the same circle at severall obliquities of my eye, partly by other meanes, as also by making use of the two Prisms for very great obliquities; I found its diameter, & consequently the thicknesse of the plate of Air at its perimeter in all those obliquities to be very nearely in the proportions which I have expressed in this Table. The angle of incidence on the Plate of Air0d, 0'.6d, 26'.12d, 45'.18d, 49'.24d, 30'.29d, 37'.33d, 58'.35d, 47'.37d, 19'.38d, 33'.39d, 27'.40d, 0'.40d, 11' The angle of refraction made into that Air0d.10d.20d.30d.40d.50d.60d.65d.70d.75d.80d.85d.90d. Then diameter of the coloured circle10.10113101310341137121214151317192212261235 The thicknesse of the Air at the perimeter of that circle1010161023111213151220231229375070120 I have not yet observed what variation the colours of a Plate which is denser then the ambient Medium, will suffer by the like obliquation of the eye, but it seemes to be very little. Obs 8. The centrall dark spot also in the middle of the circles increased alittle by the obliquityation of the eye, although almost insensibly. But between the Prisms its increase was more manifest when viewed so obliquely that no colours appeared about it. It was least when the rays were indcident most obliqeluy on the plated Air, & increased more & more untill the coloured circles appeared, & then decreased again but not so much as it increased before. And hence it is evident that that transparenciy was not onely at the absolute contact of the glasses, but also where they had some little intervall. I have sometimes observed the diameter of that spot to be between half & two fift parts of athe diameter of the exterior perimeter of the Red in the first circle when viewed almost perpendicularly; whereas when viewed obliquely it hath wholly vanished & become opake. Whence it may be collected that the glasses did then scarcely or not at all touch one another, & that theair intervall at the perimeter of that spot when veiewedviewed perpendicularly was about a 5t or 6t part of their intervall at the perimeter of the said Red circle. Obs 9. Wetting the Object glasses a little at their edges, the water crept in slowly between them, & the circles thereby became lesse & the colours more faint: In so much that as the water crept along one half of them at which it first arrived would appeare broken of from the other half & contracted into a lesse room. By measuring them I found the proportion of their diameters to the diameters of the like circles made by air to be about seven to eight, & consequently the intervalls of the glasses at like circles caused by those two Mediums are about thre to four. Perhaps it may be a generall rule, that if any other Medium more or lesse dense then water be compressed between the glasses, their intervall at the circles caused thereby will be to their intervall caused by interjacent Air, as the sines are which measure the refraction made out of that Medium into Air. Obs. 10. When the water was between the glasses ifas in the I pressed the upper glasse - variously at its edges to make the circles nimbly move from one place to another, a little bright spot would follow the center of them, which upon creeping in of the ambient water into that place would presently vanish. Its appearance was such as interjacent519 521jacent Air would have caused, & it exhibited the same colours. But it was not Air, for where any aereal bubbles were in the water they would not vanish. The reflexion must rather have been caused by a subtiler Medium which could recede through the glasse at the creeping in of the water. Obs: 11. Wetting plates of Muscovy glasse whose thinnesse made the like colours appeare, the colours became more faint especially by wetting the plate on that side toward opposite to the eye, but I could not perceive any variation in their species. So that the thicknesse of a plate requisite to produce any colour depends onely on the density of the plate & not of the ambient Medium. And hence by the 9th observation may be known the thicknesse of watry bubbles, or plates of muscovy glasse or of other substances which they have at any colour produced by them. Obs: 12. A plated bodiey which is denser then its ambient Medium, exhibits more brisque & vivid colours then that which ir rarer; as I have particularly observed in Glasse & Air. For blowing glasse very thin at a lamp Furnace, those plates incompassed with Air did exhibit colours much more vivid then those of Air plated between two glasses. Obs: 13. By looking through the two contiguous object glasses without any water between them, I found that the interjacent Air exhibited coloured circles as well by transmitting light as by reflecting it. The centrall spot was white, & from it the order of the colours were Yellow, Red, Black; vViolet, Blew, white, Yellow, rRed; Violet, Blew, Green, Yellow, Red, &c. The first yYellow, & Red like the blew & violet in the 4th Obs were so little as scarcely to be discerned, & all the other colours were exceeding faint & dilute, unlesse when the light was trajected very obliquely through the glasses. For by that meanes they became pretty vivid. Comparing the coloured circles made by reflexion with these made by transmission of the light, I found that wWhite was opposite to bBlack, Red to Blew, Yellow to Violet, & Green to a compound of Red & Violet. That is, those parts of the glasse were black when looked through which when looked upon appeared white, & on the contrary. And so those which in one case exhibited bBlew, did in the other case exhibit Red. And the like of the other colours. These observations were made in the open Air. But further to examin the effects of coloured light falling on the glasses, I darkened the Room, & by viewing them by reflection of the colours of a Prism cast on a sheet of white paper I made the following observations. Obs: 14. Appointing an Assistant to move the Prism to & fro about its axis that all its colours might sucecessively fall on the same place of the paper & be reflected from the circles to my eye whilst I held it immoveable; I found the circles which the red light made, to be manifestly bigger then those which were made by the blew. And it was very pleasant to sesee them gradually swell or contract accordingly as the colour of the light was changed. The intervall of the glasses at any of the circles Rings when they were made by the utmost red light, was to their intervall at the same circle Ring when made by the utmost purple light Violet, greater then 3 to 2 & lesse then 5 to 3. By the most of my observations it was as 9 to 14. And this proportion seemed seemed the same in all obliquities of my eye., but in very great obliquities I have not yet observed it. Obs 15. And that intervall of the glasses which was an arithmeticall mean between these two, the light was of a middle colour between green & yellow; & the extent of the red was much greater then almost double to that of the Violet: contrary to what happens in the colours of made by the refraction of a Prism, where the Red is most contracted, the violet most expanded, & in the midst of them is the confine of green & yellow blew. Obs: 16. These circles Rings were not of various colours like those in the open air, but appeared all over of that Prismatick colour onely with which they were illuminated. And further by projecting the Prismatick colours directly upon the glasses I found that the light which fell on the dark spaces between the coloured circles Rings, was transmitted through the glasses without any variation . For on a white paper it would paint circles Rings of the same colour with those which were reflected, & of the bignesse of their intermediate spaces. And from hence the origins of these circles Rings is manifest, namely that the aereall intervall of the glasses according to its various thicknesse, is disposed in some places to reflect & in others to transmit the light of any colour, & in the same place to reflect one colour where it transmits another. Obs 17. The circles were here distincter & visible to a greater number then in the open Air. Obs: 18 And by making them all successively emerge in the middle, that I might more nicely compare the quantity of their light; the reflexion seemed to be something stronger from that circle which next incompassed the contact of the glasses, then from the exterior circles. And so in the open Air the whitenesse reflected from the first or inmost circles was stronger then the whitenesse or light reflected from the glasses at those parts which were without the circles, as I could very manifestly distingusish by viewing them at distance. And the same thing is observable of the outmost rings of the colours which appeare in thin plates of Muscovy-glasse in a contrary order, being caused by fissures or cavities within the glasse which are thinnest at their edges. Having520 522 Having given you my Observations on these colours it will not be difficult by some of them to unfold the causes of the others. To which end the 5t, 7th, 14th, 15th & 16th Observations doe principally conduce. And first to show how the colours in the 4th & 13 Observations are produced, let there be taken in any right line, the lengths QR Qa & Qh in proportion as 4, 9 & 14, & between them Ra & Rh eleven meane proportionalls, of which let Rb be the 2d, Rc the 3d, Rd the 5t, Re the 7th, Rf the 9th & Rg the 10th. And at the points a, b, c, d &c erect perpendiculars aα, bβ, cγ, &c. by whose intervalls the extent of the severall colours set against them is to be represented. Then divide the line aα in such proportion as the numbers 1, 2, 3; 5, 6, 7; 9, 10, 11; &c set at the points of division denote, & through those divisions from Q draw occult lines 1k, 2l, 3m; &c. crosse the perpendiculars, & let the intervalls between 1k & 3m, 5n & 7p &c be shaddowed faintly at the edges & more copiously intensely towards the middle to represent there the strongest reflexion of each colour. Now if a2 be supposed to represent the thicknesse of any plated body at which the deepest violet is most copiously reflected in the first ring or series of colours, then by the 14th Observation hl will represent its thicknesse at which the deepest or extreame Red is most copiously reflected in the same series. Also by the 5t & 14th Observations a6 & ho will denote the thicknesse at which those extreame colours are most copiously reflected in the second series, & so on. And the thicknesse at which any of the intermediate colours are reflected most copiously, will be defined by the intermediate parts of the lines 2l, 6O, &c; according to the 15th Observation But further to define the latitude of these colours in each ring or series, let a1 designe the least thicknesse & a3 the greatest thicknesse at which the extreame purple in the first series is reflected, & let hk & hm designe the like limits for the extreame red, & the intermediate colours be limited by the intermediate parts of the lines 1k,& 3m. And in the second series let those limits be the lines 5n & 7p; and so on. This being premised, to know what colour must in the open Air be exhibited at any thicknesse of a plated body, let a ruler be applyed parallel to ah, at that distance from it by which the thicknesse of the plate is represented: & the shaddowed spaces which it crosseth will denote the reflected originall colours of which the colour exhibited in the open Air is compounded. Thus if the constitution of the green in the middle of third series of colours be desired; apply the rRuler as you see at XZ, & by its passing through some of the blew at X & yellow at Z, as well as through the green at Y, you may conclude that the green exhibited at that thicknesse of the plate, is principally constituted of originall green but not without a mixture of some blew & yellow. By this meanes you may know how the colours from the center of the rings outwards ought to succeed in order as they were described in the 4th Observation. For if you move the Ruler gradually from ah through all distances, it will first arrive at 1 the violet, & then very quickly at the blew & green which together with that violet compound blew, & then at the yellow & red by whose further addition that blew is converted into whitenesse, which whitenesse almost continues during the transit from k to 3, & after that by the successive deficience of its component colours it turnes first to compound yellow & then to red, & last of all the red ceaseth at m. So that in this first series the colours on either side the white are compounded much after the same manner with those of the Prism explained in the 8th Experiment, but the violet & blew are here but very little in proportion to the red & yellow. Then begin the colours of the second series which succeed in order between 5 & p, & are more lively then before, because more expanded & severed. And for the same reason instead of the former white there intercedes between the blew & yellow a mixture of orang, yellow, green, blew, & some blewish violet, all which together ought to exhibit a dilute & imperfect green. So the colours of the third series all succeed in order, first the violet which a little interferes with the red of the second circle Order, & is thereby inclined to a reddish purple; then the blew & green which are lesse mixed with other colours & consequently more lively then before, especially the green; then follow the yellow & red which are mixed with the violet & blew of the 4th series, whereby various degrees of yellow, orang, scarlet & & purplish Red inclining to purple are compounded, & the blew is much diminished being for the most part converted into purple almost mixed with the former Red by the mixture of red. Then follows a pretty copious green which is the most eminent & conspicuous colour in that 4th series; & after that the severall series interfere more & more & their colours become more & more intermixed till after 3 or 4 more revolutions (in which the Red & Blew predominate by turnes) all sorts of colours are in all places pretty equally blended & so by diluting one another compound an eaven whitenesse. And since by the 16th Observation one colour is transmitted where another is reflected, the reason of the colours made by the transmitted light in the 13th Observation is also hence evident. But further to explain the Phænomena of the 2d & 3d Observations that5213 that is how these colours may (by turning the Prisms about their axis common axis the contrary way, to that expressed in those observations) be converted into white & black rings, and afterwards into colours again in an inverted order: it must be remembered that those colours are dilated by the obliquation of the rays to the plated Air, & that according to the table in the 7th observation, their dilatation or recession from their common center is most manifest & speedy when they are obliquest. Now the rays of yellow being more refracted by the first superficies of the plated of Air which intercedes the Glasses then those of red, are thereby made more oblique to the second superficies at which they are reflected to produce these colours. And consequently the yellow in each ring will be more dilated then the red, & the excesse of its dilatation will be so much the greater by how much the greater is the obliquity of the rays. untill at last it become of equall extent with the red of the same ring. And for the same reason the green blew & violet will be also so much dilated by the still greater obliquity of their rays as to become all very nearely of equall extent with the red, or that is, equally distant from the center of the rings. And then all the colours of each ring the same or series must be coincident, & by their mixture exhibit a white rings. which And these white Rings must have black or dark rings between them because they doe not spread & interfere with one another as before. And for that reason also they must be distincter & visible to far greater numbers. But yet the violet being obliquest will be something more dilated in proportion then the other colours, & so very apt to appeare at the exterior verges of the white. Afterwards by a greater obliquity of the glasses rays, the violet & blew become sensibly more dilated then the red & yellow, & so being further removed from the center of the rings, the colours must emerge out of the white in an order contrary to that which they had before, the violet & blew at the exterior limbs of each Ring Ring & the red & yellow at the interior. And the violet by reason of the greatest obliquity of its rays being in proportion most of all expanded, will soonest appeare at the exterior limb of each white circle Ring , & become more conspicuous then the rest. And then the severall series of colours by their unfolding & spreading will begin again to interfere, & thereby render the rings lesse distinct & not visible to so great numbers. There is yet another circumstance of these experiments to be considered, & that is why the black & white circles Rings which when viewed at distance appeare distinct, should not onely become confused by viewing them neare at hand, but also yeild a violet colour at both the edges of every white circle Ring. And the reason is that the rays which letthe eye at severall parts of the pupill, have severall obliquities the plated Air which is between the Glasses, & those which are the most oblique, if considered apart would represent the circles bigger then those which are the least oblique. Whence the breadth of the perimeter of each white circle every circle Ring is expanded outwards by the obliquest rays & inwards by the least oblique. And this expansion is so much the greater by how much the greater is the difference of obliquity, that is, by how much the pupill is wider, or the eye nearer to the glasses. And the breadth of the violet must be most expanded because the rays apt to excite a sensation of that colour are most oblique to the further superficies of the plated Air at which they are reflected, & have also there the greatest variation of obliquity, which makes that colour soonest emerge out of the edges of the white. Andlso as the breadth of each circle is thus augmented, the dark intervalls must be diminished more & more untill the neighbouring rings become continuous & are blended, the exterior first, & then those nearer the center, so that they can no longer be distinguished apart, but seem to constitute an eaven & uniforme whitenesse. These are the principall Phænomena of colours Plated Bodies which thin Plates or Bubbles whose explications depend on those the properties of light that I have heretofore delivered, which & these you see do necessarily follow from them, & punctually agree with them even to their very least circumstances.; And & not onely so, but in some measure very much tend to their proof. For considering the multitude of rings & other circumstances in the 3d & 17th Observations nothing can be more evident then that although in the 4th Observation there appeare no more then 8 or 9 rings of colours yet there are really a far greater number which so much interfere & mingle as after those 8 or 9 revolutions to dilute one another wholly & constitute an eaven & sensibly uniform whitenesse. And consequently that whitenesse must be allowed a mixture of all colours. To make this more fully appeare I shall tell you a very another very odd experiment which these considerations not long since suggested to me, & upon tryall suceceded somthing beyond my first expectations. And it is that when the two Object-glasses, as in the said 4th Observation were layd one upon the other so as to make the coloured rings appeare, though with my naked eye I could not discerne above 8 or 9 of those rings yet by viewing them through a triangular glasse Prism I have seen a far greater multitude, insomuch that I could number more then fourty besides many others that were so very small & close together that I could not keep my eye so steddy, on them severally as to number them. But by the proportion of their extent I have sometimes estimated them to be more then a hundred, & I beleive the experiment may be improved to the discovery of far greater numbers. For they seem to be really unlimited, though visible onely so far as they can be separated by the refraction. 5224 I have sometimes so played one Object-glasse on the other that to the naked eye they have all over seemed uniformely white without the least appearance of any of the coloured rings, & yet by viewing them through a Prism great multitudes of those rings have discovered themselves. And in like manner plates of Muscovy-glasse & bubbles of of water & of glasse blown at a lamp furnace which which were not so thin as to exhibit any colours to the naked eye, have through the Prism exhibited a great variety of them ranged irregularly up & down the plate in the forme of waves. From whence it deserves to be considered that out of light or whitenesse in appearance uniform, & without any termination with shaddow or darknesse colours may be made to emerge by viewing it through a Prism. And that the refractions of a Prism which render almost all things confused that to the naked eye appeare distinct should make these rings appeare exceedingly distinct which to the naked eye are so confused & blended together as not at all to be discernable apart. By the first consideration the whitenesse must be allowed a heterogeneall mixture or confusion of those coloured circles which emerge. By the second it is manifest that the refractions of each ray considered apart are regularly performed without spreading or dissipating it into any diverging parts. For admitting such an irregularity it would be impossible for refractions to render those circles so very distinct & well defined. And from both the said considerations it follows that the rays of severall colours made as well by plated bodies as by the refractions of Prisms have severall degrees of refrangibility whereby those of each order have which at their reflexion are intermixed with those of other orders, are separated from them by refraction, & associated together so as to become visible by themselves But before I further give you the reason of these Phænomena tis convenient that I describe their circumstances more particularly, the principall of which are these. That when the it was but one side of the rings made by the two Object glasses, namely that towards the angle of the Prism comprehended by the refracting planes, which by the refraction was rendered distinct, & the other side became more confused then to the naked eye, in so much that there, I could not discerne above one or two & sometimes none of those rings of which I could discerne 8 or 9 with my naked eye. Also the order of the colours neare the center on that side towards the distinct arcs was usually inverted. And if the refraction was too great the middle part of those arcs became confused so as to constitute in appearance an uniforme whitenesse, whilst on either hand the ends of those arcs, as also the whole arcs furthest from the center remaine became distintctest And the arcs where they appeared distinctest, were onely white & black successively without any other colours intermixed. So that if I first held my eye & the Prism very neare the object glasses & then gradually removed them it further of towards my eye, the colours of the 2d, 3d, & 4th rings &c shrunk towards the white that was emerged between them untill they wholly vanished into it at the middle of the arcs & afterwards emerged again in a contrary order. to that at the ends. Having told you these circumstances the reason of them you will perceive by supposing the concentrick circles AD & BC to represent the red & violet of any order or revolution of the colours. For these being viewed througthrough a Prism the violet circle BC will by a greater refraction be further translated from its place then the red AD, & so approach nearer to it on that side towards which the refractions are made. For instance if the red be translated to ad, the blew violet may be translated to bc so as to approach nearer to it at c then before & if the red be further translated to ad, the bl violet may be so much further translated to bc as to convene with it at c, & if the red be yet further translated to αδ, the violet may be still so much further translated to βγ as to passe beyond it at γ & into convene with it at e & f. And this being understood not onely of the red & violet but of all the other intermediate colours & also of every revolution of those colours, you will easily perceive how those of the same revolution or order by their nearnesse at cd & δγ, & their coincidence at cd, e & f ought to constitute pretty distinct arcs of circles (especially at cd o at e & f) & that they will appeare severally appeare at cd, at cd exhibit whitenesse by their coincidence, & again appeare severally at δγ, but yet in a contrary order to that which they had before & still retain beyond e & f. But on the other side at ab, ab, or αβ these colours must become much more confused by being dilated & spread so as to interfere with those of other orders. And the same confusion will happen at δγ between e & f if the refraction be very great, or the Prism very distant from the object-glasses, in which case no patsrts of the ring will bee seen save onely two little arcs at e & f, whose distance from one another will be augmented by removing the Prism still further from the object glasses. And these must be distinctest & whitest at their middle, & coloured at their ends where they begin to grow confused they must be coloured. And the colours at one end of every arc must be in a contrary order to those at the other end, by reason that they crosse in the intermediate white. Namely their ends which verge towards δγ will be red & yellow on that side next525 next the center, & blew & violet on the other side, But their other ends which verge from δγ will be on the contrary be blew & violet on that side towards the center, & on the other side red & yellow. For confirmation of all this I need alledgallege no more then that it is mathematically demonstrable from my former pPrinciples. But yet I shall add that they which please to take the paines may by the testimony of their senses be assured that these explications are not Hypotheticall but infallibly true & genuine & more then Hypotheticall.. For in a dark Room by viewing these rings through a Prism by reflexion of the severall Prismatick colours which an Assistant causes to move to & fro upon the a wall or paper from whence they are reflected, whilest the spectators eye, the Prism, & the object-glasses (as in the 14th Observation,) are placed steddy: the position of the circles made by the severall colours apart successively, will be found such in respect of one another as I have described at aabcd, or abcd, or αβδγ. ✝ Concerning small fragments of plated glasse plates there is this further observable, that if they lying flat upon a table be turned about their centers, the most whilst they are viewed through a Prism; the most of them will in all positions exhibit waves, & that for the most part appearing almost all over the glasse, [& parallel or almost parallel to the length of the Prism]. ✝ The reason is that the superficies of such plates are not eaven but have many cavityies & swellings which how shallow soever do a little vary the thicknesse of the plate & that irregularly. And by the severall sides of those cavities there must be produced waves in severall postures of the Prism. Now though it may be but some very small & narrow parts of the glasse whereby these waves for the most part are caused yet they may seem to extend themselves about over the whole glasse, because from the narrowest of those parts there are colours of severall orders confusedly reflected which by refraction of the prism are unfolded & dispersed to severall places so as to constitute so many severall waves as there were divers orders of the colours promiscuously reflected from that part of the glasse. Of the Colours of naturall bodies. I am now come now to the last part of my present this designe, which is to consider how the Phænomena of plated bodies thin transparent Plates stand related to those of all other naturall bodies, the usuall objects of our senses; ✱ that we may be thereby in some measure enabled to understand what constitutions are requisite in those bodies to make them appeare of various colours. And this I shall endeavour in the following propositions. 1. That the small parts of all naturall bodies (those of metalls perhaps & some other ponderous minerall substances which are of a mercuriall originall being excepted) are transparent. And to this they that have been conversant with Microscopes will easily assent. 2. That between the parts of coloured or opake bodies are many intervalls replenished with Mediums of other densities; as water between the tinging corpuscles wherewith any liquor is impregnated, Air between the globules that constitute clouds or mists most part spaces voyd of both Air & water but yet perhaps replenished with some subtiler Medium between the parts of naturall bodies And this also will easily be by them that have contemplated bodies by the assistance of a Microscope or by chemicall examinations observed their heterogeneous constitution or taken notise how they may be pervaded by Menstruums, & Metalls by Quicksilver. But yet for further assureance you may remember that according to the 1st Observation there is no reflexion made in the superficies of homogeneall parts of pellucid bodies where they are contiguous; but if they be of different densities there will be a reflexion proportionall to that difference. As may be tryed in glasse which reflects lesse when contiguous to water then when to Air, & still lesse when contiguous to spirit of whine or oyle of vitrioll. So that to render bodies very opake tis either requisite that their density differ very much from the density of the adjacent Medium, Or that there be that multitudes of reflecting superficies succedinge one another, the latter of which may interrupt the rays which passe through the former. From the first of these causes cheifely may arise the absolute opacity of qQuicksilver & metalline bodies which seems to reflect all most of all the light incident on their its outmost superficies; & from the last must be derived the opacity of bodies which are not so dense as to have their least parts opake. And that this is a sufficient cause you will easily apprehend by considering that the most transparent substances may by separating their parts be rendered sufficiently opake, as water by being formed into many small bubbles, or glasse by being reduced to powder or otherwise flawed And that by the 18th Observation the reflexions of very thin transparent substances thare considerably stronger then those made by the same substances of a greater thicknesse. And also by the 12th Observation that the colours of a denser substance incompassed with a rarer are more strong & lively then those of a rarer substance incompassed with a denser. To which I may add that if something conduces to the reflexion of solid bodies that the interstices of their parts are voyd of Air. For that for the most part they are so is reasonable to beleive, considering the ineptitude which Air hath to pervade small cavities, as appeares by the ascention of water in glasse pipes, paper, cloth & other such like substances whose pores are found too small to be replenished with Air & yet large enough to admit water; & by the difficulty wherewith Air pervades the pores of a bladder through which water finds ready passage. And according to the 10th Observation, the cavities thus voyd of Air will cause the same kind of effects as to reflexion which those do that are replenished with it, but yet something more manifestly because the Medium in relation to refractions is rarest when most empty of Air as Mr Hook hath proved in his Micrographia. In which book he hath also largely discoursed of these two Propositions, & delivered many other very excellent things concerning the colours of plated bodies & other naturall bodies, which I have not scrupled to make use of so far as they were for my present purpose. 3. The parts of bodies & their interstices must not be lesse then of some definite bignesse to render them opake or coloured. F the opakest bodies if their parts be very subtily divided (as metalls by being dissolved in acid Menstruums &c) become perfectly transparent. And you may also remember that in the 8th Observation there was no reflexion at the superficies of the Object-glasses where they were very neare one another though they did not absolutely touch. On these grounds also I 5246 conceive it is that water, salts, glasse; stones & such like substances are transparent. For upon divers considerations they seem to be as porous as other bodies, but yet their pores too small to cause any opacity. 4. The transparent parts of bodies according to their severall thicknes sizes must reflect rays of one colour & transmit those of another, on the same grounds that plated bodies doe reflect or transmit those rays. And this I take to be the ground of all their colours. For if a plated body which being of an uniform eaven thicknesse appeares all over of one uniform colour; should be broken into fragments of the same thicknesse with the plate; I see no reason why a heap of those fragments should not constitute a pouder of the same colour which the plate exhibited before it was broken. And the parts of all naturall bodies being like soe many fragments of a plated body, must on the same grounds exhibit the same colours. Now that they doe so will further appeare by the affinity of their properties. As that the infusion of Nephritic Wood & many other substances reflect one colour & transmit another, like plated bodies in the 13 Observation tThat the colours of silks, cloaths, & other substances which water or oyle can intimately penetrate, become more faint & obscure by being immerged in those liquors & recover their vigor again by being dryed, much after the manner declared of plated bodies in the 9th & 11th Observations. And TThat some of those coloured pouders which Painters use may have their colours a little changed by being very elaborately & finely ground. Where I see not what can be justly pretended for those changes besides the breaking of their parts into lesse parts by that contrition, after the same manner that the colour of a plate is changed by varying its thicknesse. For which reason also it is that many flowers by being brused become more transparent then before or at least in some degree or other change their colours. Nor is it much lesse to my purpose to consider that by mixing divers liquors, very odd & remarqueable productions & changes of colours may be effected, of which no cause can be more obvious then & naturall then that the saline corpuscles of one liquor doe variously act upon or unite with the tinging corpuscles of another liquor so as to make them swell or shrink, (whereby not onely their bulk but their density also may be changed;) or to divide them into smaller corpuscles;, or make many of them associate into one cluster. For we see how apt those saline Menstruums are to penetrate & dissolve substances to which they are applyed & some of them to precipitate what others dissolve. In like manner if we consider the various Phænomena of the Atmosphære, we may observe that when vapors are first raised, they hinder not the transparency of the Air, being divided into parts too small to cause any reflexiōon in their superficies. But when in order to compare drops of rain they begin to coalesce & constitute globules of all intermediate sizes; those globules when they become of a convenient size to reflect some colours & transmit others, may constitute clouds of sizes colours according to their sizes. And indeed I see not what can be rationally conceived in so transparent a substance as water for the production of these colours besides the various sizes of its parcells, which seem to affect a globular figure most, but yet not without some instability in the smallest of them by reason that those are most easily agitated by heat or any in the Air. 5. By meanes of the 4th, 5t, 6t, 9th & 11th Observations, we may be inabled in some measure to guesse at the bignesse of the parts of a body by its colour, provided that those parts must be of the same thicknesse with a plated body of equall density to exhibit the same colour. And to this end I have in the following table expressed the thicknesse of plated Air, Water, & Glasse requisite to produce the severall colours of each order. The method which I used to determine it was by moving a streight rRuler over the precedent scheme parallel to the line ah, as I told you. In which scheme suppose st, tv, vw &c ( to represent the difference of the thicknesses of plated Air exhibiting the severall orders of yellow) represents that is 180000 of an inch according to the 6t Observation; & rs will be half that difference or represents 1160000. Which being known, the thicknesse requisite to exhibit any other colour is easily determidned by that scheme. And since by the 9th Observation the thicknesse of plated Air is to that of plated glasse water exhibiting the same colour, as 4 to 3, & to that of plated glasse as 31 to 20; the thicknesse of those plated Mediums at which they represent any colour will on the same grounds be also determined. And these thicknesses at which each colour is most intense & specific in the foure first orders, I have expressed in the following Table expressed in parts of an inch divided into ten hundred thousand parts. Thethicknesseof AirWaterGlasse Violet2122123 The ColoursBlew32142 Of theWhite64124 first OrderYellow834612523 Red1013734623 ___________________ Violet131310812 Of theBlew15231313410 2d OrderGreen17123411 Yellow18231412 Red2216121415 ___________________ Violet25183416 Of theBlew2720141712 3d OrderGreen2921341823 Yellow311323122015 Red3412262214 ___________________ Purple37273424 Of theBlew38342925 4th orderGreen41312612 Yellow431232122812 Red461334343013 Now since the parts of naturall bodies are supposed to exhibit the same colours with a plated body of equall thicknesse, provided they have the same refractive density; & since their parts seem for the most part to have much the same density with water or glasse, as by many circumstances is obvious to collect: you need onely have recourse to the tables for water or glasse to determin the sizes of these parts. Thus if it be desired to know the diameter of a corpuscle which being of equall density with glasse, shall reflect green of the third order; the number 1823 shows it to be about 18231000000 parts of an inch. It is not impossible but that the sizes of the pores of bodies may sometimes conduce to the production of their colour. And for that reason I have added a table for plated Air whose refractive density is not considerally different525 527 different from that of spaces voyd of Air such as I suppose to be the pores of bodies. But yet these pores seem to be of such irregular sizes that I cannot understand how they should all conspire to reflect any one colour much more then another By the way I cannot but observe another use to be made of this Table which is to determin what colour must be produced by laying two or more plated bodies upon one another so as to compose one plate equalling them all in thicknesse. For instance Mr Hook observes that a faint yellow plate of Muscovy Glasse layd upon a blew one constitutesd a very deep purple. Now the yellow of the first order is a faint one, & the thicknesse of the plate exhibiting it according to the Table is 523, to which add 1023 the thicknesse exhibiting blew of the second order & the summ will be 15 23 which most nearely approaches 16 the thicknesse exhibiting the purple of the third order. But to apply these Tables more particularly to the determining the sizes of the parts of bodies by their colours tis convenient that I now consider to what order the intensest colours are most usually to be referred, which will be easily done by meanes of the fourth Observation as it is explained by the afforesaid Scheme. And first for Scarlet & other Reds oranges & Yellows, if they be pure & intense they are most probably of the second or third order. The best yellow is of the third order, is also good But Those of the 1 & 3 they are also order also may be pretty good, onely the Red of the that 3d order hath too great a mixture of Blew & Violet. There may be very good Greens of the 4th order but the purest seeme to be are of t of the third. And of this order I conceive the green of all Vegetables to be, partly from the intensenesse of their colours & partly because when they wither some of them turne to a greenish yellow, others to a more perfect yellow or Orange, & some (as the Oak leafe) to a pretty deep red, passing first through all the afforesaid intermediate colours. Which or perhaps to a Red passing first through all the aforesaid intermediate colours. changes seem to be effected by the exhaling of the moisture which leaves the tinging corpuscles more dense, & something augmented by the accretion of the oyly & earthy part of that moisture. Now the Green without doubt is of the same order with those colours into which it changeth because the changes are graduall, & those colours though usually not very pure yet fore the most part are too pure & lively to be of the fourth order. As for bBlews & Purples they may be either of the second or third order. But the best are of the third. Thus the colour of Violets seems to be of that order, because their Syrup by acid liquors turne red & by urinous or alcalizate turne green Now since it is of the nature of acids to dissolve or alternate & of Alcalies to precipitate or incrassate, if the purple colour of the Syrup was of the second order, an acid liquor by attenuating its tinging corpuscles would change it to a red of the first order, & an Alcaly by incrassating them would change it to a green of the second order, which red & green especially the Green seem too imperfect to be the colours produced by these changes. But if the said purple be supposed of the third order, its change to red of the 2d & green of the third order may without any inconvenience be allowed. Whitenesse if it be intense is either that in the first order of colours, (of which sort perhaps is the colour of white Lead,) or else it is a mixture of those succeding the 3r or 4th order, such as is the colour of paper, ffroth, linnen, & many other most white substances. If corpuscles of various sizes exhibiting the colours of the second & third order be mixed they seem should rather to constitute an imperfect whitenesse or gGrey of which I have already spoken;. bBut yet it seemes not impossible but that these also might may constitute for them to exhibit an intense whitenesse if when if they were be disposed to transmit all the light which they reflect not, & do not retain & stifle some of it. For thus I have observed of told you that froth made with water in which soape or that it hath at a distance exhibited hath appeared very white & yet neare at hand the severall bubbles of which it was constituted. have neare at hand exhibited were seen all the over tinged with the Rings of colours. in the of the four or five first orders Lastly for the production of Black it seemes necessary to suppose that the corpuscles are must be lesse then any of those which exhibit colours, because at all greater sizes there is too much light reflected to constitute theise colours. But if they be supposed a litle lesse then is requisite to reflect the violet Blew of the firtst order (as perhaps about the eight or ten hundred thousandth part of an inch more or lesse in diameter,) they will according to the 1st 4th 17th & 16 8th Observation reflect no light at all so very little light as to appeare intensely black by which meanes they will appear black in all positions of the eye without any transparency & yet may perhaps variously refract it to & fro within themselves so long untill it happen to be stifled & lost. And this seemes to be confirmed by these considerations that Glasse ground very elaborately with sand n a Copper plate till it be well polished makes the sand together with what is worne of from the glasse & Copper become very black. That Fire & the more subtile dissolver Putrefaction turne substances to black. That small quantities of black substances impart their colour very freely intensely to substances to which they are applied. And that black substances do the soonest of all others become hot & burne, which effect may procede partly from the multitude of refractions in a little room, & partly from the easy commotion of so very small corpuscles. To which I may add this further consideration that blacks are usually a little inclined to a blewish colours as may be manifestly seen by illuminating white pa paper by reflexion from black substances, for the paper will usually appeare of a blewish white. And this ought to happen because black bordering on the obscure blew colours of the first Order, described in the Observation the larger corpuscles of black substances will soonest reflect thoseat colours. And thus much concerning the colours of naturall bodies, in which In the thus description of these colours & their origine I have been the more particular I have been the more particular because I hope that it will not be long before Microscopes will at length be improved to the discovery of their colorific corpuscles. For if those instruments can be so far improved as with sufficient distinctnesse to represent objects five or six hundred times bigger then at a foot distance they appeare to the naked eyes, I should phope that wee might be able to discover some of the greatest of those corpuscles,. & And by one that would magnify two or thre thousand times perhaps they might all be discovered but those which produce blacknesse. In the meane while I see not any thing materiall that can rationally be doubted of excepting this Position, That transparent 5268 corpuscles of the same thicknesse & density with a plated body doe exhibit the same colours. And this I would have understood not without some latitude as well because those corpuscles may be of irregular figures, & many rays must be obliquely incident & so have a shorter way through them then the length of their diameter, as because the straitnesse of the Medium pent in on all sides may a little alter its motions or other qualities on which the reflexion depends. But yet I cannot much suspect the last because I have observed of some small plates of Moscovy glasse which were of an eaven thicknesse, that through a Microscope they have appeared of the same colour at their edges & corners where the included Medium was terminated, which they appeared of in other places. However it will add much to our satisfaction if these corpuscles can be discovered with Microscopes, which if we shall at length attain to, I feare it will be the utmost improvemetnt of this Sensce. For it seemes impossible to see the more secret & noble nces workes of nature within those corpuscles by reason of their transparency. An Hypothesis hinted at for explicating all the aforesaid properties of light If it were now my designe to conjecture at the causes of these Properties which I have ascribed to light, & show whence its rays may have their different dispositions to excite in us the sensation of their severall colours, & accordingly differ in refrangibility, & also in their reflectibility from plated bodies of severall thicknesses or corpuscles of severall sizes: it would be necessary for me to pitch upon some Hypothesis. And I find none that so well answers all things as that which Mr Hook hath chosen for me; namely that Light is corporeall & consists of multitudes of very little bodies emitted every way from shining substances. Now these I should suppose to be of different sizes & velocities & accordingly to suffer different refractions in the passing out of one Medium into another; as we may observe that stones being thrown into water, the swiftest are least diverted from their course. Bur further as Air is observed to be of its own accord the thinnest in the smallest cavities, so I should suppose Æther to be thinnest in the densest bodies whose pores I take to be the smallest; & thence it might easily be explicated why refractions made into the denser Medium, are towards the perpendicular, & that in a certain proportion of the sines As to reflexions I should suppose them to be caused by the rigidnesse of the superficies of Æther such as is found in the superficies of all other fluids. Now when the irradiated corpuscles impinge on these superficies, they must excite an undulation in the Æther, something after the manner that stones thrown into water cause an undulation in its superficies. And in their passage through plated bodies if they arrive at the further superficies at the same time with the compressed & condensed part of the vibrations excited at the first superficies they are reflected, but if they arrive there with the relaxed & rarefied part they are transmitted. For the rigidnesse of the reflecting superficies must be increased or diminished accordingly as the Æther is comprest or relaxed; not to mention that the contrary motions on contrary sides of the wave may very much conduce to this effect. This I conceive will suffice to explicate how it may depend on the thicknesse of a plate or corpuscle whither light shall be reflected or transmitted, & how light may be reflected at one thicknesse & transmitted at another to an indefinite number of successions. And if it be further supposed that the rays which cause a violet & blew colour excite shorter vibrations in the Æther then those which cause red & yellow, it will also appeare why the first should be reflected at a lesse thicknesse of a Plate then the last. But further when light is incident on the bottom of the eye it must excite the same vibrations in the Æther which pervades the Retina that it doth in that of all other transparent substances. And those vibrations being propagated in order through the severall fibers of the Optick nreve into the Brain may there affect the soule with a sensation of various colours according to their various proportions, something after the manner that various sounds are produced by various proportions of the vibrations of the Air. The harmony and discord also which the more skilfull Painters observe in colours may perhaps be effected & explicated by various proportions of the æthereall vibrations as those of sounds are by the aëreall. To which end I would suppose the vibrations causing the deepest scarlet to be those causing the deepest violet as two to one; for there would be all that variety in colours which within the compasse of an eight is found in sounds, & the reason why the extreames of colours the deepest Violet & Red Purple & scarlet resemble one another would be the same that causes Octaves (the extreames of sounds) to have in some measure the nature of unisons. I should further suppose that when an irradiated corpuscle of light in passing through a body chanceth to impinge on any of its parts, it will not be reflected but stick fast till by the dissolution of that body, or some new commotion it be again set at liberty. And by this meanes it is that many bodies appeare obscure or black, namely those which refract or reflect light so long to & fro within themselves till it happen to dash against their parts. And to give you an account why they then stick fast, you may consider how Air excluded from between two polished marbles or plates of glasse causeth them strongly to adhhere by compressing them together on the out side. So Æther may cause the suspension of Quicksilver in the Torricellian experiment at a much greater height then 29 inches; for it ought to croud the parts of such bodies together since it is supposed to be more dense & springy without then within them. And this seemes to be the principall cause of the cohesion of the parts of all naturall bodies, composing them for the most part first into those very small clusters which I have hitherto called corpuscles, & then aggregating those clusters into greater . And much after the same manner it is that when a corpuscle of light 5279 To these I added two other Rules, whereof one was to know the proportion of the sines measuring the refractions of homogeneall rays made out of one Medium into another, by knowing the proportions of the sines measuring the refractions of those rays made out of Air or any third Medium into those two. And the other was to know the difference of the refractions of heterogeneall rays alike incident out of any Medium into any other Medium, by knowing the difference of their refraction out of glasse into Air The first rRule is, that as the ratio of the given sines of incidence to the ratio of the given sines of refraction, so are the desired sines of incidence & refraction to one another. For instance if the sine of incidence be to the sine of refraction out of Air into water as 4 to 3, & out of Air into Glasse as 31 to 20 to know the refractions out of water into glasse, I say as 314 the ratio of the given sines of incidence to 203 the ratio of the given sines of refraction, that is as 93 to 80, so is the sine of incidence to the sine of refraction made out of water into glasse. The other Rule is, that if refractions be made out of divers Mediums into one common Medium with equall incidence, the differences between the common sines of incidence & the sines of the refractions of difform rays shall have a given ratio. Suppose for instance the common sine of incidence out of glasse into Air be 4414, & the sine of refraction for the utmost purple 69, &for the utmost red 68, & for the meane between blew & green (the rays which have a middle betdegree of refrangibility) 6812. So shall their difference be 2434 2334 & 2414. Suppose further that the sine of incidence out of water into air for the said meane rays between blew & green be to the sine of refraction as 3 to 4. Then say as 1 the difference of these sines to 3 the sine of incidence, so 2414 the difference of the other correspondent sines, to a fourth number 7234, which instead of 3 suppose to be the common sine of incidence out of water into Air, & to it adding 2434, 2334, & 2414, you have 9712, 9612, & 97 the sines of refraction of the afforesaid rays, namely 9712 of the utmost purple 9612 of the utmost red & 97 of the rays exhibiting a middle colour between blew & green. In like manner to know the refractions of difform rays made out of water into gGlasse, suppose their common sine of incidence out of Air into gGlasse be 106, & the sines of refraction of the extreame purple 68 of the extreme red 69, & of the middle rays exhibiting a colour between blew & green 6812. Which sines subduct from the sine of incidence, & there remains 38, 37, & 3712. Suppose also that the sine of incidence out of water into glasse for the said middle rays is to the sine of refraction as 93 to 80 & say as 13 the difference of these sines to 93 the sine of incidence so 3712 the difference of the other correspondent sines to a fourth number 264913, which being put the common sine of incidence if you subtract from it 38, 37, & 3712, the remainders 226913, 227913, & 227526 will be the sines of refraction out of water into glasse for the afforesaid difform rays.",NATP00126,1675-01-01 00:00:00
150,Isaac Newton,Science,Draft of the 'Discourse Concerning Light and Colors',"MS Add. 3970.3, ff. 501r-517r",c. early 1675,England,['English'],"499 501 Sir I suppose you understand that all transparent substances (as Glass water, Air &c) when made very thin by being blown into bubbles or otherwise formed into plates, doe exhibit various colours according to their various thinnesse, although at a greater thicknesse they appeare very cleare & colourlesse. In my former discourse about the constitution of light, I ommited these colours, because they seemed of a more difficult consideration, & were not necessary for establishment of the Doctrine which I propounded. But because they may conduce to further discoveries for completing that Theory, especially as to the constitution of the parts of naturall bodies on which their colours or transparency depend, I have now sent you an account of them. To render this discourse short & distinct, I have first described the principall of my Observations, & then considered & made use of them. The Observations are these: Obs: 1. Compressing two Prisms hard together that their sides (which by chance were a very little convex) might somewhere touch one another, I found the place in which they touched to become absolutely transparent as if they had there been one continued piece of Glasse. For when the light fell so obliquely on the Air which in other places was between them, as to be all reflected; it seemed in that place of contact it was to be wholly transmitted: in so much that when looked upon it appeared like a black or dark spot by reason that no little or no sensible light was reflected from thence as from other places; & when looked through it seemed (as it were,) a hole in that Air whatich was formed into a thin plate by being compressed between the glasses. And through this hole Objects that were beyond might be seen distinctly which could not at all be seen through other parts of the glasses where the Air was interjacent. Although the glasses were a little convex yet this transparent spot was of a considerable breadth, which breadth seemed principally to proceed from the yeilding inwards of the glasses by parts of the glasses by reason of their mutuall pressure For by pressing them very hard together it would become much broader then otherwise. Obs: 2. When the plate of Air, by turning the Prisms about their common Axis became so little inclined by the incident rays, that some of them began to be transmitted, there arose in it many slender arcs of colours which at first were shaped almost like a Conchoid as you see them here delineated. And by continuing the motion of the Prisms, these arcs increased & bended more & more about the said transparent spot, till they were completed into circles or rings incompassing it, & afterwards continually 2 grew more & more contracted. These parcs at their first appearance were of a violet & blew colour, & between them were white arcs of circles which presently (by continuing the motion of the Prisms) became a little tinged in their inward limbs with red & yellow, & to their outward limbs the blew was adjacent. So that the order of these colours from the centrall dark spot, was at that time White, Blew, vViolet; bBlack ; Red, Orange, Yellow, White, Blew, Violet; &c. But the Yellow & Red were much fainter then the bBlew & vViolet. The motion of the Prisms about their Axis being continued these colours contracted more & more, shrinking towards the whitenesse on either side of it untill they totally vanished into it. And then the circles in those parts appeared black & white without any other colours intermixed. But by further inclining moving the Prisms about, the colours again emerged out of the whitenesse, the violet & blew at its ––– inward limb, & at its outward limb the red & yellow. So that now their order from the centrall spot was White, Yellow, Red; Black; Violet, Blew, White, Yellow, Red, &c. contrary to what it was before. Obs: 3 When the rings or some parts of them appeared onlly black & white, they were very distinct & well defined, & the blacknesse seemed as intense as that of the centrall spot. Also in the vicine places borders of the rings where the colours began to emerge out of the whitenesse, they were pretty distinct, which made them visible to a very great multitude. I have sometimes numbered above thirty successions (recconing every black & white ring for one succession,) & seen more of them which by reason of their smallnesse I could not number. But in other positions of the Prisms at which the rings appeared of many colours, I could not distinguish above 8 or 9 of them, & the exteriour of those too were rvery confused & dilute. In these two Observations to see the colourrings distinct, & without any other colour but black & white, I found it very necessary that I to hold my eye at a good distance from them. For by approaching nearer, although in the same inclination of my eye to the plane of the rings, yet there emerged a blewish colour out of the white, which by dilating it selfe more & more into the black rendered the circles lesse distinct, & left the white a little tinged with red & yellow. I found also that by looking through a slit or oblong hole which was narrower then the pupill of my eye & held close to it parallel to the Prisms, I could see the circles much distincter & visible to a far greater number then otherwise. Obs: 4. To observe more nicely the order of the colours which arose out of the white circles as the rays became lesse & lesse inclined to the plate of Air; I took two object glasses the one a plano-convex for a fourteen foot Telescope, & the other a large double convex for one of about fifty foot, & upon this laying the other with its plane side downwards, I pressed them slowly together to make the colours successively5005023sively emerge in the middle of the circles & then slowly lifted the upper glasse from the lower to make them successively vanish again in the same place, where being of a considerable breadth, I could more easily discerne them. And by this means I observed their succession & quantity to be as followeth. Next to the pellucid centrall spot made by the contact of the glasses, succededed Violet, Blew, White, Yellow, & Red. The violet & Blew wereas so very little in quantity that I could not discerne them it in the circles made by the Prismes, nor could I well distinguish any violet in it,, but the Yellow & Red were pretty copious & seemed about as much in extent as the white, & foure or five times more then the Blew & Violet. The next circuit or order of colours immediately incompassing these was vViolet Blew, gGreen, Yellow, & Red. And these were all of them copious & vivid excepting the green which was very little in quantity & seemed much more faint & dilute then the other colours. Of the other four the Violet was least & the blew lesse then the yellow or red. The third circuit or order was also Purple, Blew, Green, Yellow, & Red in which the purple seemed a little more reddish then the Violet in the former circuit, & the Green was much more conspicuous, being as brisque & lively copious as any of the other colours aexcept the Yellow, but the Red began to be a little faded inclining very much to purple. After these succeeded in the fourth circuit Green & Red. The gGreen was very copious & lively, inclining on one side to blew & on the other to yellow. But in this 4th circuit there was neither violet blew nor yellow, & the Red was very imperfect & dirty. Also the succeeding colours became more & more imperfect & dilute till after three or four more revolutions they ended in perfect whitenesse. Obs: 5. To determin the intervall of the glasses or thicknesse of the interjacent Air by which each colour was produced, I measured the diameters of the first six rings at the most lucid part of their Orbits, & squaring them I found their squares to be in Arithmeticall progression of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. And therefore since one of the glasses was plane & the other sphericall, their intervalls at those rings must be in the same progression. I measured also the diameters of the dark or faint rings between the more lucid colours & found their squares to be in Arithmeticall progression of the eaven numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. And it being very nice & difficult to take these measures exactly I repeated them divers times at divers parts of the glasses, that by their agreement I might be confirmed in them. And the same Method I used in determining some others of the following Observations. Obs: 6. The diameter of the sixt ring at the most lucid part of its orbit was 58100 parts of an inch, & the diameter of the Sphere 4 on which the double convex object glass was ground was 102 foot, as I found by measuring it; & consequently the thicknesse of the Air, or Aereall intervall of the glasses at that ring was 114554 of an inch. For as the diameter of the said sphere (102 foot or 1224 inches) is to the semidiameter of the ring 29100 so very nearely is that semi-diameter to 114554 the said distance intervall of the glasses. Now by the preceedent Observation the eleventh part of this distance intervall (1160094) is the thicknesse of the Air at that interval part of the first ring where the most lucid of the colours the citrine Yellow would be most most vivid were it nor mixed with other colours in the white of this ring, & this doubled gives the difference of their intervalls its thicknesses at the citrine Yellow in all the other rings. viz 180047 or to use a round number, the eighty thousandth part of an inch. Obs: 7. These dimensions were taken when my eye was placed perpendicularly over the glasses in or neare the axis of the rRings But when I viewed them obliquely they became bigger, continually swelling as I removed my eye further from their Axis. And partly by measuring the diameter of the same circle at severall obliquities of my eye, partly by other meanes, as also by making use of the two Prisms for very great obliquities, I found its diameter, & consequently the thicknesse of the Air at its perimeter in all those obliquities to be very nearly in the proportions expressed in this Table Angle of Incidence on the Air.Angle of Refraction into the Air.Diameter of the Ring.Thicknesse of the Air. 00gr. 00min00gr. 00g min.10.10. 6. 26.10. 00.10113.10215. 12. 45.20. 00.1013.1023. 18. 49.30. 00.1034.1112. 24. 30.40. 00.1125.13. 29. 37.50. 00.1212.1512. 33. 58.60. 00.14.20. 35. 47.65. 00.1514.2314. 37. 19.70. 00.1645.2814. 38. 33.75. 00.1914.37. 39. 2780. 00.2267.5214. 40. 085. 00.29.84110. 40. 1190. 00.35.12212. In the two first Collumns are expressed the obliquities of the incident & emergent rays to the Plate of Air, that is their angles of incidence & refraction. In the third Collumn the diameter of any coloured Ring at those obliquities is exprest in parts of which ten constitute th at diameter when the rays are perpendicular. And in the 4th Collumn the thicknesse of the Air at the circumference of that Ring is exprest in parts of which also 10 constitute that thicknesse when the rays are perpendicular. Obs. 8.5035 Obs: 8. The dark spot in the middle of the Rings increased also by the obliquation of the eye; although almost insensibly. But if instead of the Object-glasses the Prisms were made use of, its increase was more manifest when viewed so obliquely that no colours appeared about it. It was least when the rays were incident most obliquely on the interjacent Air, & as the obliquity decreased it increased more & more untill the coloured rings appeared, & then decreased again, but not so much as it increased before. And hence it is evident that the transparency was not onely at the absolute contact of the glasses but also where they had some little intervall. I have sometimes observed the diameter of that spot to be between half & two fift parts of the diameter of the exterior circumference of the Red in the first circuit or revolution of colours when viewed almost perpendicularly; whereas when viewed obliquely it hath wholly vanished & become opake & white like the other parts of the glasse. Whence it may be collected that the glasses did then scarcely or not at all touch one another, & that their intervall at the perimeter of that spot when viewed perpendicularly was about a 5t or a 6t part of their intervall at the circumference of the said Red Obs: 9. By looking through the two contiguous Object-glasses, I found that the interjacent Air exhibited Rings of colours as well by transmitting light as by reflecting it. The centrall spot was now white, & from it the order of the colours were Yellowish Red; Black; Violet, Blew, White, Yellow, Red; Violet, Blew, Green, Yellow, Red, &c But these colours were very faint & dilute unlesse when the light was trajected very obliquely through the glasses. For by that meanes they became pretty vivid. Onely the first Yellowish Red, like the Violet & blew in the 4th Observation was so little & faint as scarcely to be discerned. Compareing the coloured Rings made by reflexion, with these made by transmission of the light; I found that White was opposite to Black, Red to Blew, Yellow to Violet, & Green to a compound of Red & Violet. That is, those parts of the glasse were black when looked at through which when looked upon appeared white, & on the contrary. And so those which in one case exhibited blew did in the other case exhibit Red. And the like of the other colours. Obs: 10. Wetting the Object glasses a little at their edges, the water crept in slowly between them, & the circles thereby became lesse & the colours more faint: in so much that as the water crept along one half of them at which it first arrived would appeare broken of from the other half & contracted into a lesse Room. By measuring them I found the proportion of their diameters to the diameters of the like circles made by Air to be about seven to eight, & consequently the intervalls of the glasses at like circles caused by these two Mediums water & air are as about three to four. Perhaps it may be 6 a generall Rule that if any other Medium more or lesses dense yn water be compressed between the glasses, their intervall at the Rings caused thereby will be to their intervall caused by the interjacent Air, as the sines are which measure the refraction made out of that Medium into Air Obs: 11. When the water was between the glasses if I pressed the upper glasse variously at its edges to make the Rings move nimbly from one place to another, a little bright spot would –––– immediately follow the center of them, which upon creeping in of the ambient water into that place would presently vanish. It's appearance was such as interjacent Air would have caused, & it exhibited the same colours. But it was not Air, for where any aereall bubbles were in the water they would not vanish. The reflexion must rather have been caused by a subtiler Medium which could recede through the Glasse at the creeping in of the water. Obs: 12. These Observations were made in the open Air. But further to examin the effects of coloured light falling on the Glasses, I darkened the Room & viewed them by reflexion of the colours of a Prism cast on a sheet of white paper my eye being so placed that I could see the coloured paper by reflexion in the glasses as in a looking glass.. And by this meanes the Rings became distincter & visible to a far greater number then in the open Air. I have sometimes seen more then 20 of them, whereas in the open Air I could not discerne above 8 or 9. Obs: 13. Appointing an Assistant to move the Prism to & fro about its Axis, that all itsthe colours might successively fall on theat plart of the paper which I saw by reflexion from that part of the glasses where the circles appeared & be so that all the colours might be successively reflected from the circles to my eye whilst I held it immoveable; I found the circles which the Red light made to be manifestly biger then those which were made by the Blew & Violet. And it was very pleasant to see them gradually swell or contract accordingly as the colour of the light was changed. The interval of the Glasses at any of the rings when they were made by the utmost red light was to their intervall at the same Ring when made by the utmost Violet, greater then 3 to 2 & lesse then 13 to 8. By the most of my Observations it was as 9 to 14 to 9. And this proportion seemed very nearely the same in all obliquities of my eye; unlesse when two Prisms were made use of instead of the Object-glasses. For then at a certain great great obliquity of the rays to the plate of air between the Prisms of my eye the Rings made by the severall colours seemed equall, & at a greater greater obliquity those made by the Violet would be greater then the same Rings made by the Red. Obs 14. While the Prism was turned about uniformly its axis with an eaven motion The Contraction or dilatation of a Ring made by all the severall colours of the Prism successively reflected from the Object-Glasses, was swiftest in the Red, slowest in the Violet, & in intermediate colours it had intermediate degrees of celerity. Comparing the extent or breadth of the rings or variation of the Air's thickness which each colour obteined or moved V moved through over & took up by this contraction or dilatation I50247 I found that the Blew was sensibly more extended then the Violet, the Yellow then the Blew, & the Red then the Yellow. And to make a juster estimation of their proportions I observed that the extent or breadth of the Red squared that is the variation of the thickness of the air where all the red by contraction & dilatation appeared was almost double to that of the Violet, & that the light was of a middle colour between Blew Yellow & Green at that intervall of the Glasses which was an Arithmeticall mean between the two extreames intervalls whichere reflected the whole of the colours began & ended: contrary to what happens in the colours made by the refraction of a Prism, where the Red is most contracted, the Violet most expanded, & in the middst of them all the colours is the confine of Green & Blew. Obs: 15. These Rings were not of various colours like those in the open Air but appeared all over of that Prismatique colour onely with which they were illuminated. And by projecting the Prismatique colours immediately upon the glasses, I found that the light which fell on the dark spaces which were between the coloured Rings, was transmitted through the Glasses without any variation of colour. For on a white paper placed behind, it would paint Rings of the same colour with those which were reflected, & of the bignesse of their intermediate spaces. And from hence the origine of these Rings is manifest, namely that the aereall intervall of the glasses, according to its various thicknesse, is disposed in some places to reflect, & in others to transmit the light of any colour, & in the same place to reflect one colour where it transmits another. Obs: 16. The squares of the diameters of these Rings made by any Prismatique colour were in Arithmeticall Progression as in the 5t Observation. And the diameter of the sixt circle when made by the citrine Yellow & viewed almost perpendicularly, was about 58100 parts of an inch, agreable to the 6t Observation. The precedent oObservations were made with a rarer thin Medium terminated by a denser, such as was Air or water ––– comprest between two Glasses. In those that follow are set down the appearances of a denser Medium thin'd within a rarer, such as are pPlates of Moscovy Glasse, Bubbles of Water, & some other thin substances terminated as all sides with Air Obs: 17. If a Bubble be blown with water, first made tenacious by dissolving a little soape in it, tis a common observation that after a while it will appeare tinged with a great variety of colours. To defend these bubbles from being agitated with by the externall Air (whereby their colours are irregularly moved one among another, so that no accurate observation can be made of them,) as soon as I had blown any of them I covered it with a cleare glasse, & by that meanes its colours emerged in a very regular order like so many concentrick rings incompassing the top of the bBubble. And 8 as the bubble grew thinner by the continuall subsiding of the water these rings dilated slowly & overspread the whole bubble descending in order to the bottom of it where they vanished successively. In the meane while after all the colours were emerged at the top, there grew in the center of the Rings a small round black spot like that in the first Observation which continually dilated it selfe till it became sometimes more then 12 or 34 of an inch in breadth before the Bubble brake. At first I thought there had been no light reflected from the water in that place, but observing it more curiously I saw within it severall smaller round spots which appeared much blacker & darker then the rest, whereby I knew that there was some reflexion of at the other places which were not so dark as thatose spots. And by further tryall I found that I could see the images of some things (as of a candle or the Sun) very faintly reflected not onely from the great black spot but also from the little darker spots which were within it. Besides the afforesaid coloured Rings there would often appeare small spots of colours ascending & descending up & down the sides of the Bubble, by reason of some inequalities in the subsiding of the water. And sometimes small black spots generated at the sides of would ascend up to the larger black spot at the top of the Bubble & unite with it. Obs: 18. Because the colours of these Bubbles were more extended & lively then those of Air thind between towo Glasses, & so more easy to be distinguished: I shall here give you a further description of thereir order as they were observed in viewing them by reflexion of the Skies when of a white colour, whilst a black substance was placed behind the bubble. And they were these; Red, Blew; Red, Blew; Red, Blew; Red, Green; Red, Yellow, Green, Blew, Purple; Red, Yellow, Green, Blew, Violet; Red, Yellow, White, Blew, Black. The three first successions of Red & Blew were very dilute & dirty, especially the first where the Red seemed in a manner to be white Amongst these there was scarcely any other colour sensible, onely the Blews (& principally the second blew) inclined a little to Green. The fourth Red was also dilute & dirty but not so much as the former three; After that succeeded little or no Yellow, but a copious Green which at first was inclined a little to yellow, & then became a pretty brisque & good Willow gGreen, & afterwards changed to a blewish colour; but there succeeded neither Blew nor violet. The fift Red at first was inclined very much inclined to purple & afterwards became more bright & brisque but yet not very pure. This was succeeded with a very bright & intense Yellow, which was but little in quantity, & soon changed to Green: But that Green was copious & something more pure deep & lively then the former Green. After that50359 that followed an excellent Blew of a bright Sky colour, & then a Purple which was lesse in quantity then the Blew & much inclined to Red. The sixt Red was at first of a very faire & lively Scarlet, & soon after of a brighter colour being very pure & brisque & the best of all the Reds. Then after a lively Orange followed an intense bright & copious Yellow, which was also the best of all the Yellows; & this changed first to a Greenish Yellow, & then to a Greenish Blew; but the Green between the Yellow & Blew was very little & dilute, seeming rather a Greenish White then a Green. The Blew which succeeded became very good & of a fair Bright Sky colour, but yet something inferior to the former Blew, And the Violet was intense & deepe with little or no rednesse in it And lesse in quantity then the Blew In the last Red appeared a tincture of Scarlet next the Red Violet, which soon changed to a brighter colour inclining to an Oran Orange; And the Yellow which followed was at first pretty good & lively but afterwards it grew more & more dilute untill by degrees it ended in perfect whitenesse. And this whitenesse, if the water was very tenacious & well tempered, would slowly spread & dilate it selfe over the greatest part of the bubble, continually growing paler at the top, where at length it would crack in many places, & those cracks as they dilated would appeare of a pretty good, but yet obscure & dark sky colour; the white between the Blew spots diminishing, untill it resembled the threds of an irregular net=work, & soon after vanished & letft all the upper part of the Bubble of the said dark Blew colour. And this colour after the afforesaid manner dilated it self downwards untill sometimes it hath overspread the whole Bubble. In the meane-while at the top, which was of a darker Blew then the bottom & appeared also full of many round blew spots something darker then the rest, there would emerge one or more very black spots & with those other spots of an intenser blacknesse, which I mentioned in the former Observation; &And these continually dilated themselves untill the Bubble brake. If the water was not very tenacious the Black spots would break forth in the white without any sensible intervention of the blew. And sometimes they would brekak forth within the precedent Yellow, or Red, or perhaps within the Blew of the second order before the intermediate colours had time to display themselves. By this description you may perceive how great an affinity these colours have with those of Air described in the 4th Observation, although set down in a contrary order by reason that they begin to appeare when the Bubble is the thickest, & are most conveniently recconed from the lowest & thickest part of the Bubble upwards. Obs: 19. Viewing at severall oblique positions of my eye the Bubbles Rings of colours emerging on the top of the Bubble, I found that they 10 were sensibly dilated by increasing the obliquity, but yet not so much by far as those made by thinned Air in the 7th Observation. For there they distended were dilated so much as, when viewed most obliquely, to arrive at a part of the Plate more then twelve times thicker then that where they appeared when viewed perpendicularly, whereas in this case the thicknesse of the water at which they arrived when viewed most obliquely, was to that thicknesse which exhibited them by perpendicular rays something lesse then 8 to 5. By the best of my oObservations it was between 15 & 1512 to 10; an increase about 24 times lesse then in in the other case. Sometimes the Bubble would become of an uniform thicknesse all over except at the top of it neare the black spot, as I knew because it would exhibit the same appeareance of colours in all ––– positions of the eye: And then the colours which were seen at its apparent circumference by the obliquest rays would be different from those that were seen in other places by rays lesse oblique to it. And divers Spectators might see the same part of it differing colours by viewing it at very differing obliquities. Now observing how much the colours at the same place of the Bubble or at divers places of equall thicknesse were varied by the severall obliquities of the rays; by assistance of the 4th 14th 16th & 18th Observations, as they are hereafter explained, I collected the thicknesse of the water requisite to exhibit any one & the same colour at severall obliquities to be very nearely in the proportion expressed in this Table. Incidence on the Water.Refraction into the Water.Thicknesse of the water. 00degr.. 00min.00degr.. 00min.10. 15. 00.11. 11.1014. 30. 00.22. 1.1045. 45. 00.32. 2.1145. 60. 00.40. 30.13. 75. 00.46. 25.1412. 90. 00.48. 35.1515. In the first two Collumns are expressed the obliquities of the rays to the superficies of the water, that is their angles of incidence & refraction. Where I suppose that the sines which measure them are in round numbers as 3 to 4, though probably the dissolution of soape in the water may a little alter its refractive virtue. In the third collumn the thicknesses of the Bubble at which any one colour is exhibited in those severall obliquities, is exprest an parts of which ten constitute that thicknesse when the rays are perpendicular. I have sometimes observed of the colours which arise out of on polished Steel when heating it, or on Belmstall & some other Metalline substances when melted & poured on the ground where504611 where it may cook in the open Air, that they have, like these of water-bubbles, been a little changed by viewing them at divers obliquities, & particulary that a deep blew of violet when viewed very obliquely hath been changed to a deep Red. But the changes of these colours are not so great & sensible as of those made by water. For the Scoria or vitrified part of the Metall which most Metalls when mheated or melted do continually protrude to their surface where & which by covering them metalls in forme of a thin glassy skin, causes these colours, is much denser then water; and I find that the change made by the obliquation of the eye is least in colours of the densest thin substances. Obs: 20. As in the 9th Observation so here the Bubble by transmitted light appeared of a contrary colour to that which it exhited by reflexion. Thus when the Bubble being looked on by the light of the clouds reflected from it, seemed Yellow or Red at its apparent circumference, if the clouds at the same time were or very suddenly immediately after were viewed through it, the colour at its circumference would be blew or Purple or Blew. And on the contrary when by reflected light it appeared Blew, it would appeare Red by transmitted light. Obs: 21. By wetting very thin Plates of Moscovy-glasse whose thinnesse made the like colours appeare, the colours became more faint; especially by wetting the Plates on that side opposite to the eye; but I could not perceive any variation of their species. So that then the thicknesse of a plate requisite to produce any colour depends onely on the density of the Plate & not on that of the ambient Medium. And hence by the 10th & 16th Observations may be known the thicknesse of which Bubbles of Water or thin plates of Moscovy-glasse, or of other substances, which they have at any colour produced by them. Obs: 22. A thin transparent body which is denser then its ambient Medium, exhibits more brisque & vivid colours then that which is so much rarer; as I have particularly observed in Air & Glasse. For blowing Glasse very thin at a Lamp Furnace, those plates incompassed with Air did exhibit colours much more then vivid then those of Air made thin between two glasses. Obs: 23. Comparing the quantity of light reflected from the severall Rings, I found it was most copious from the first or inmost, & in the exterior Rings became gradually lesse & lesse. Also the whitenesse of the first Ring was stronger then that reflected from those parts of the thinned Medium which were without the Rings; as I could manifestly perceive by viewing at the a distance the Rings made by the two Object glasses; Or by compareing two bubbles of water blown at distant times in the first of which the whitenesse appeared which succeded all the colours, & in the other the whitenesse which preceded them in the other all . Obs: 24. When the two Object-Glasses were layd upon one another so as to make the Rings of Colours appeare, though with my naked eye I 12 could not discerne above 8 or 9 of those rings yet by viewing them through a Prism I have seen a far greater multitude, insomuch that I could sometimes number more then fourty besides many others that were so very small & close together that I could not keep my eye so steddy on them severally as to number them. But by their extent I have sometimes estimated them to be more then a hundred. And I beleive the experiment may be improved to the discovery of far greater numbers. For they seem to be really unlimited, though visible onely so far as they can be separated by the refraction, as I shall hereafter explaine. But it was but one side of these rings, namely that towards which the refraction was made, which by that refraction was rendered distinct, & the other side became more confused then to when viewed by the naked eye, insomuch that I there I could not discerne above one or two, & sometimes none of those rings, of which I could discerne 8 or 9 with my naked eye. And their segments or arcs which on the other side ––– appeared so numerous, did not for the most part exceeded not ed not the third part of a circle. If the refraction was very great or the Prisms very distant from the Object-glasses, the middle part of those arcs fbecame also confused so as to disappeare & constitute an eaven whitenesse, whilst on either side their ends of those arcs, as also the whole arcs furthest from the center became distincter then before, appearing in the forme you see them here designed. The arcs when they seemed distinctest were onely white & black successively without any other colours intermixed. But in other places there appeared colours whose order was inverted by the refraction in such manner that if I first held the Prism very neare the Object-Glasses & then gradually removed it further of towards my eye, the colours of the 2d 3d 4th & following Rings shrunk towards the white that emerged between them, untill they wholly vanished into it at the middle of the arcs, & afterwards emerged again in a contrary order. But at the ends of the arcs they retained their order unchanged. I have sometimes so layd one Object-glasse upon tanhe other that to the naked eye they have all over seemed uniformly white without the least appearance of any of the coloured rings; & yet by viewing them through a Prism great multitudes of those rings have discovered themselves. And in like manner Plates of Moscovy-Glasse & bubbles of Glasse blown at a Lamp-Furnace which were not so thin as to exhibit any colours to the naked eye, have through the Prism exhibited a great variety of them ranged irregularly up & down in the form of waves. And so bubbles of water before they began to exhibit their colours to the naked eye of a by stander have appeared through a Prism, girded about with many parallel & horizontal Rings; to produce which effect, it was necessary to hold the Prism parallel or very nearely parallel to the Horizon, & to dispose it so that the rays might be refracted upwards.",NATP00122,1675-01-01 00:00:00
152,Isaac Newton,Science,Draft of the 'Discourse concerning Light and Colors',"MS Add. 3970.3, ff. 549r-567v",c. early 1675,England,['English'],"5635491 SR I suppose you understand that all transparent substances (as Glasse, water, Air &c) when made very thinne by being blown into bubbles or otherwise formed into plates, doe exhibite various colours according to their various thinnesse, although at a greater thicknesse they appear very clear & colourlesse. In my former discourse about the constitution of light, I omitted those colours, because they seemed of a more difficult consideration, & were not necessary for stablishment of the Doctrine which I propounded. But because they may conduce to further discoveries for completing that Theory, especially as to the constitution of the parts of naturall bodies on which their colours or transparency depend, I have now sent you an account of them. To render this discourse short & distinct, I have first described the principall of my observations & then considered & made use of them. The Observations are these. Obs: 1. Compressing two Prisms hard together that their sides (which by chance were a very little convex) might somwhere touch one another, I found the place in which they touched to become * *Note that there is some little light reflected from the those parts of this black spot where the glasses by reason of their convexity & some little uneavenness of their surfaces do not come to absolute contact. For by viewing the sun by reflexion from this spot, not only the verges of it became lucid, but divers lucid veins & specks appeared into the midst of the thickness. But yet some parts of the spot seemed still as black as before I take . absolutely transparent, as if they had been there one continued peice of Glasse. for when the light fell so obliquely on the Air, which in other places places was between them, as to be all reflected; in that place of contact it was seemed wholy transmitted: in so much that when looked upon it apeared like a black or dark spot by reason that no sensible light was reflected frōom thence as frōom other places; & when looked through it seemed as it were, a hole in yetthat Air that was formed into a thinner plate by being compressed between yetthat glasses. And through this hole objects that were beyond might be seen distinctly which could not at all be seen through other parts of the gGlasses, where the Air was interjacent. Although the glasses were a little convex yet this transparent spot was considerable breadth, which breeadth seemed principally proceed frōom the yeilding inwards of the parts of the glasses reason of their mutual pressure. For by pressing them hard together it would become much broader then other. 2 Obs: 2. When the plate of Air, by turning the Prisms about their com̄mmon Axis became so little inclined to the incident rays, that some of them began to be transmitted; there arose in it many slender Arcs of coloures which at first were shaped almost like the conchoid as you see them here delineated. And by the continuing the motion of the Prisms, those Arcs increased & bended more & more about the said transparent spot, till they were completed into circles or rings incompassing it, & afterwards continually grew more & more contracted. These Arcs at their first appeareance were of a bviolet & blew colour, & between them were white Arcs of circles which presently became a little tinged in their inward limbs with red & yellow, & to their outward limbs the blew was adjacent. So that the order of those colours frōom the Centrall dark spot, was at that time white, Blew, Violet; Darknesse Black; Red, Orang, yellow, White Blew, Violet, &c. But the yellow & Red were much fainter then the Blew & Violet. The motion of the Prisms about their Axis being continued those colours contracted more & more, shrinking towards the whitenesse on either side of it, untill they totally vanished into it. And then the circles in those parts appeared black & white without any other colours intermixed. But by further m moving the Prisms about, the colours again emerged out of the whitenesse, the Violet & blew at its inward limb, & at its outward limb the red & yellow. So that now their order frōom the centrall spot was white, Yellow, Red, Black, Violet, Blew ywhite, yellow, Red, &c. contrary to what it was before. Obs: 3. When the rings at some parts of them appeared only black & white, they were very distinct & wel-defined & the blacknesse seemed as intense as that of the Centrall Spot. Also in the places Borders of these rings where the colours began to emerge out of the whitenesse, they were pretty distinct, which made them visible to a very great multitude. I have sometimes numbered above thirty successions (recconing every black & white ring for one succession) & seen more of them which by reason of their smalnesse I could not number. But in other Positions of the Prisms at which the appeared of many colours, I could not distinguish above of them, & the exteriour of those too were dilute. In these two Observations to see the Colours rings any other colour but black & white, I found 56455023 that I held my eye at a good distance frōom them. For by approaching nearer, although in the same inclination of my eye, yet there ged a blewish colour out of the white, which by deilating it selfe more & more into the black rendered the circles lesse distinct & left the white a little tinged with red & yellow. I found also that by looking through a slit or oblong hole which was narrower then the pupill of my eye & held close to it paralell to the Prisms, I could see the circles much distincter & visible to a far greater number then otherwise. Obs: 4. To observe more nicely the order of the colours which arose out of the white circles as the rays became lesse & lesse inlclined to the plate of Air; I took two Objectglasses the one of a plano-convex for a fourteen foot Telescope, & the other a large double convex for one of fifty foot, & upon this laying the other with its plane side downwards, I pressed them slowly together to make the colours successively emerge in the middle of the Circles & then slowly lifted the upper glasse frōom the lower to make them successively vanish again in the same place, where being of a considerable bredth, I could more easily discern them. And by this meanes I observed their succession & quantity to be as followeth. Next to the pellucid centrall pot made by the contact of the glasses succeeded Violet, Blew, White, Yellow, & Red. The Violet & blew were soe very little in quantity that I could not discerne them in the circles made by the Prisms, but the yellow & Red were pretty copious, & seemed about as much in extent as the white, & 4 or 5 times more then the blew & Violet. The next circuit or order of colours imediately incompassing these was Violet, Blew, Green, yellow, & Red. And these were all of them copious & vivid excepting the green which was very little in quantity & seemed much more faint & dilute then the other colours. Of the other four the Violet was least & the blew lesse then the yellow or Red. The third circuit or order was also Purple, Blew, Green, yellow, & Red, in which the Purple seemed more redish then the Violet in the former circuit, & the green was much more conspicuous, being as bris & copious as any of the other colours except the yellow, but the Red began to be a little faded inclining very much to purple. After these succeded Green & Red. The Green was very copious & lively inclining on the side to blew & the other to theyellow. But in this 4th circuit was neither Violet, blew, nor yellow & the red was very imꝑperfect & dirty. Also the succeeding colours became more & more imꝑperfect & dilute after three or four more revo Revolutions they ended in ꝑperfect whitenesse. Obs: 5. To determine the intervall of the glasses, or thicknesse of the interjacent Air by which each colour was produced, I measured the diameters of the first six rings at the most lucid part of their Orbits & squaring them I found their Squares to be in Arithmeticall progression of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. And since one of the glasses was plane & the other Sphericall their intervalls at those rings must be inof the same proportiongression. I measured also the diameters of the dark or faint rings between the more lucid colours & found their squares to be in Arithmeticall progression of the eaven numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. And it being very nice & difficult to take those measures exactly I repeated them diverse times at divers parts of the glasses, that by their agreement I might be confirmed in them. And the same Method I used in determining some others of the following observations. Obs: 6. The diameter of the first ring at the most lucid part of its orbit was 58100 parts of an inch & the diameter of the Sphere on which the double convex object glasse was ground was 102 foot, as I found by measuring it; & consequently the thicknesse of the Air, or Aereall intervall of the glasses at that ring was 114554 of an inch. For as the diameter of the said sphere (102 foot or 1224 inches) is to the semi diameter of the ring 29100 so very nearly is that semi diameter to 114554 the said distance of the glasses. Now by the precedent observations the eleventh part of this distance (1160094) is the thicknesse of the Air at that part of the first ring where the yellow would be most vivid were it not mixed with other colours in the white, & this doubled gives the difference of its thicknesses at the yellow in all the other rings. viz 180047 or to use a round number the eighty thousandth part of an inch. Obs: 7. Those dimensions were taken when my eye was placed perpendicularly over the glasses in or near the Axis of the Rings, but when I viewed them -->oblily they became bigger continually swelling as I removed my eye further frōom their Axis. And partly by measuring the diameter of the same Circle at severall obliquities of my eye, partly as also by making use of the two Prisms for tios, I found its diameter, & consequently the thicknesse at its Perimeter in all those obliquities to be Proportions expressed in this Table. 5655518 Incidence on the Air.Refraction into the Air.Diameter of the RingThicknesse of the Air. gr. min.gr. min 00. 00.00. 00.10.10. 6. 26.10. 00.10113.10213. 12. 45.20. 00.1013.1023. 18. 49.30. 00.1024.1112. 24. 30.40. 00.1125.13. 29. 37.50. 00.1212.1512. 33. 58.60. 00.14.20. 35. 47.65. 00.1514.2313. 37. 19.70. 00.1645.2812. 38. 33.75. 00.1914.37. 39. 27.80. 00.2267 5214. 40. 0.85. 00.2984. 40. 11.90. 00.3512212. In the two first Columns are expressed the obliquities of the rayes to the pPlate of Air, that is their angles of inciden & refraction. In the third Column the diameter, of any coloured Ring in those obliquities, is exprest in parts of which ten constitute that diameter when the rayes are perpendicular. And in the fourth Column the thicknesse of the Air at the Circūumference of that Ring is exprest in parts of which also 10 constitute that thicknesse when the rayes are perpendicular. Obs. 8. The dark Spot in the middle of the Rings increased also by the obliquation of the eye although almost in sensibly But if in stead of the Object-glasses the Prisms were made use of, its increase was more manifest when viewed soe obliquely that no colours appeared about it. It was least when the rays were incident most obliquely on the interjacent Air & increased more & more untill the coloured rings appeared, & then decreased again but not soe much as it increased before. And hence it is evident that the transparency was not only at the absolute contac of the glasses but also where they had some little intervall. I have sometimes observed the diameter of that spot to be between halfe & two fift parts of the diameter of the exterior circumference of the Red in the first circuit or revolution of colours when viewed almost perpendicularly, wheras when viewed oblily it hath wholy vanish'd & become opake & white like the other parts of the glasse. Whence it may be collected that the glasses did then scearclyscarcely or not at all touch one another, & that their intervall at the perimeter of that Spot when viewed perpendicularly was about a 5th or 6th part of their intervall at the circumference of the said Red. Obs: 9. By looking through the two contiguous o)bject-glasses, I the interjacent Air exhibited Rings of colours as well by reflecting it. The centrall Spot The centrall Spot was now white, & frōom it the order of the colours were yellowish Red, Black, Violet, Blew, white, yellow, Red; Violet Blew, Green, yellow, Red &c. But these colours were very faint & dilute unlesse when the light was trajected very obliquely through the glasses, For by that means they became pretty vivid. Onely the first yellowish-Red, like the blew in the 4th Observation was soe little & faint as scearcely, to be discerned: comparing the coloured Rings made by reflexion, with those made by transmission of the light I found that white was opposite to black, Red to blew, yellow to Violet & green to a compound of Red & Violet. That is, those parts of the glasse were black when looked through, which when looked upon appeared white & on the contrary. And so those which in one case exhibited blew, did in the other case exbiteexhibit Red. And the like of the other colours. Obs: 10. Wetting the object-glasses a little at their edges the water crept in slowly between them & the circles thereby became lesse & the colours more faint: in so much that as the water crept along, one halfe of them at which it first arrived would appear broken off frōom the other halfe & contracted into a lesse rRoom. By measuring them I found the proportion of their diameters to the diameters of the like circles made by Air to be about seavenseven to eight, & consequently the intervalls or the glasses at like circles caused by those two mediums water & Air are as about three to four. Perhaps it may be a generall Rule that if any other medium more or lesse dense then water be compressed between the glasses, their intervall at the Rings caused thereby will be to their intervall caused by interjacent Air, as the sines are which measure the refraction made out of that Medium into Air. Obs: 11. When the water was between the glasses If I pressed the upper glasse variously at its edges to make the Rings move nimbly from one place to another, a little bright Spot would immediately follow the center of them, which upon creeping in of the ambient water into that place would presently vanish; Its appearance was such as interjacent Air would have caused & it exhibited the same colours. But it was not Air for where any aereall bubbles were in the water they would not vanish. The reflexion must rather have been caused by a sensible which could recede through the glasse at Water Obs: 12 These observations were made in ther to examine the effects of coloured light darkned the Room & viewed them by reflecxtein cast on a sheet of white paper. And by this & visible to a far another number 566552 I have sometimes seen more then 20 of them, wheras in the open Air I could not discerne above 8 or 9. Obs: 13. Appointing an Assistant to move the Prism to & frōom about its Axis, that all its colours might successively fall on the same place of the paper & be reflected from the circles to my eye whilst I held it immoveable; I found the circles which the red light made to be manifestly bigger then those which were made by the Blew & Violet. And it was very pleasant to see them gradually swell or contract accordingly as the colour of the light was changed. The intervall of the Glasses at any of the Rings when they were made by the utmost red light was to their intervall at the same Ring when made by the utmost Violet, greater then 3 to 2 & lesse then 13 to 8. By the most of my Observations it was as 9 to 14. And this proportion seemed very nearly the same in all obliquities of my eye; unlesse when two Prisms were made use of instead of the yObject-glasses. For then at a certain great obliquity the Rings made by the severall colours seemed equall, & at a greater obliquity those made by the Violet would be greater then the same Rings made by the Red. Obs: 14. While the Prism was turned about uniformly, The contraction or dilatation of a Ring made by all the severall colours of the Prism successively reflected frōom the Object glasses, was swiftest in the Red, slowest in the Violet & in intermediate colours it had intermediate degrees of celerity. comparing the extent which each colour obteined by this contraction or dilatation I found that the blew was sensibly more extended then the vViolet, the yellow then the Blew, & the Red then the yellow. And to make a juster estimation of their proportions I observed that the extent of the Red was almost double to that of the Violet, & that the light was of a middle colour between yellow & Green at that intervall of the Glasses, which was an Arithmeticall mean between the two extreames: contrary to what happens in the colours made by the refraction of a Prism, where the rRed is most contracted, the Violet most expanded, & in the midst of them is the confine of Green & Blew. Obs: 15. These Rings were not of various colours like those in the open Air but appeared all over of that Prismati colours only with which they were illuminated. And by projecting the Prismati colours im̄mmediately upon the glasses I found that the light fell on the dark Spaces which were between the coloured Rings as transmitted through the Glasses without any variation of colou on a white paper placed behind, it would paint Rings of the colour with those which were reflected & of the bignesse. And from hence And frōom hence the origine of those Rings is manifest, namely that the Aereall intervall of the glasses, according to its various thicknesse, is disposed in some places, to reflect, & in others to transmitt the light of any colour, & in the same place to reflect one colour where it transmitts another. Obs: 16. The squares of the diameters of these Rings made by any Prismati colour were in Arithmeticall progression as in the 5t Observation. And the diameter of the 6t circle when made by the yellow & viewed almost perpendicularly was about 58100 parts of an inch, agreeable to the 6t Observation. The precedent Observations were made with a rarer thin Medium terminated by a denser, such as was Air or water compressed betwixt two Glasses. In those that follow are set down the appearances of a denser medium thin'd within a rarer, such as are plates of Moscovy-glasse, Bubbles of water, & some othersother thin substances terminated on all sides with Air. Obs: 17. If a Bubble be blown with water, first made tenacious by dissolving a little soap in it tis a com̄mmon observation that after a while it will appear tinged with a great variety of colours. To defend these Bubbles frōom being agitated by the externall Air (wherby their colours are irregularly moved one among another, so that no acurate observation can be made of them,) as soon as I had blown any of them I covered it with a clear glasse, & by that means its colours emerged in a very regular order like soe many concentrick Rings incompassing the top of the Bubbles And as the Bubble grew thinner by the continuall subsiding of the water these Rings dilated slowly & overspread the whole Bubble descending in order to the bottom of it where they vanished successively. In the mean time while after all the colours were emerged at the top, there grew in the center of the Rings a small round black Spot, like that in the first observation, which continually dilated it selfe till it became sometimes more then 12 or 34 of an inch in breadth before the Bubble broak. At first I thought there had been noe light reflected frōom the water in that place, but observing it more curiously I saw within it severall smaller round spots which appeared much blacker & darker then the rest, whereby I know that there was some reflection at the other places which were not soe dark as those Spots. And by further tryall I found that I could see the images of of a candle or the Sun) very faintly reflected great black spot but also frōom the little within it. Besides the aforesaid coloured Rings pear small Spots of colours ascending the sides of the Bubble 5675539 subsiding of the water. And sometimes small black Spots generated at the sides would ascend up to the larger black Spot at the top of the Bubble & unite with it. Obs: 18. Because the colours of these Bubbles were more extended & lively then those of Air thin'd between two Glasses, & so more easie to be distinguished. I shall now give you a further description of their order as they were observed in viewing them by reflexion of the skies when of a white colour whilst a black substance was placed behind them Bubble. And they were these; Red, Blew; Red, Blew; Red, Blew; Red, Green; Red, yellow, Green, Blew, Purple; Red, yellow Green, Blew, Violet; Red, yellow, white, Blew, Black. The three first successions of Red & Blew were very dilute & dirty, specially the first where the Red seemed in a manner to be white; Amongst those there was scarcely any other colour sensible, inonely the Blewes (& principally the second,) inclined a little to Green. The fourth Red was also dilute & dirty but not so much as the former three; after that succeeded little or no yellow, but a copious green which at first was inclined a little to yellow, & then became a pretty bris and good willow Green, & afterwards changed to a blewish colour; but there succeeded neither Blew nor Violet. The fift Red at first was very much inclined to purple & afterwards became more bright & brisk but yet not very pure. This was succeeded with a very bright & intense yellow, which was but little in quantity, & soon changed to Green: But that Green was copious & something more pure, deep & lively then the former Green. After that followed an excellent Blew, of a bright sky colour, & then a purple which was lesse in quantity then the Blew & much inclined to Red. SThe sixt Red was at first of a very fair & lively scarlet, & soon after of a brighter colour being very pure & brisk & the best of all the Reds. Then after a lively Orange followed an intense bright & copious yellow, which was also the best of all the yellows; & this changed first to a greenish yellow, &then to a greenish Blew; But the green between the yellow & blew was very little & dilute, seeming rather a greenish white then a green. The blew which succeeded became very & of a fair bright sky colour, but yet something inferior to the former Blew, And the Violet was intense & which little or no rednesse in it, And lesse in quantity the Blew. In the last In the last Red appeared a tincture of Scarlet next the Violet, which soon changed to a brighter colour inclining to an Orange; And the yellow which followed was at first pretty good & lively, but afterwards it grew more & more dilute untill by degrees it ended in ꝑperfect whitenesse. And this whitenesse if the water was very tenacious & well tempered; would slowly Spread & dilate it selfe over the greatest part of the Bubble, continually growing paler at the top, where at length it would crack in many places, & those cracks as they dilated would appear of a pretty good, but yet obscure & dark sky colour; the white between the blew Spots diminishing untill it resembled the threds of an irregular nett-work & soon after vanished & left all the upper part of the Bubble of the said dark blew colour. And this colour after the aforesaid manner dilated it selfe downwards untill sometimes it hath overspread the whole Bubble. In the mean while at the top which was of a darker Blew then the bottom & appeared also of many round blew Spots something darker then the rest, there would emerge one or more very dark black Spots & within those other Spots of an intenser blacknesse, which I mentioned in the former observation And these continually dilated them selves untill the Bubble broak. If the water was not very tenacious the Black spots would break forth in the white without any sensible intervention of the blew: And sometimes they would break forth within the precedent yellow, or Red, or perhaps within the Blew of the second order before the intermediate colours had time to display themselves. By this description you may perceive how great an affinity these colours have with those of Air described in the 4th Observation although set down in a contrary order by reason that they begin to appear when the Bubble is thickest, & are most conveniently reckoned from the lowest & thickest part of the Bubble upwards. Obs: 19. Viewing at severall oblique positions of my eye the Rings of colours emerging on the top of the Bubble; I found that they were sensibly dilated by increasing the obliquity but yet not so much by far as those made by thin'd Air in the 7th Observation. For there they distended viewed most oblily to arrive at a part 12 times thicker then that where they perpendicularly, whereas in this case the at which they arriv'd when viewed most oblily which exhibited them by perpendicular Rayes 568554 By the best of my Observations it was between 15 and 1512 to 10; an increase about 24 times lesse then in the other case. Sometimes the Bubble would become of an uniform thicknesse all over except at the top of it near the black Spot; as I knew because it would exhibit the same appearance of colours in all positions of the eye: And then the colours which were seen at its apparent circumference by the obliquest rays would be different frōom those that were seen in other places by rayes lesse oblique to it. And divers spectators might see the same part of it of differing colours by viewing it at very differing obliquities. Now observing how much the colours at the same place of the Bubble or at divers places of equall thicknesse were varied by the severall obliquities of the rayes; by assistance of the 4th, 14th, 16th & 18th observations as they are hereafter explained, I collected the thicknesse of the water requisite to exhibit any one or the same colour as severall obliquities to be very nearly in the proportion expressed in this Table.

In the two first columns are experessed the obliquities of the rayes to the superficies of the water, that is their angles of incidence & refraction. Where I suppose that the sines which measure them are in round numbers as three to four, though probably the dissolution of soape in the water may a little alter its refractive Virtue. In the third column the thicknesses of the Bubble at which any one colours is exhibited in those severall obliquities, is exprest in parts of which ten constitute that thicknesse when the rays are perpendicular. I have sometimes observed of the colours which arise on polished steel by heating it, or on Bell-metall & some other me substances when melted & poured on the ground where cool in the open Air, that they have like those of water water-bubbles, been a little changed by viewing them at divers obliquities, & particularly that a deep Blew or Violet when viewed very oblily hath been changed to a deep Red. But the Changes of these colours are not so sensible as of those made by water For the coria or vitrified part of the metall which most metalls when heated or melted continually protrude to their surface where by covering them in form of a thin glassy skin it causes these colours, is much denser then water; and I find that the change made by the obliquation of the eye is least in colours of the densest thin substances. Obs: 20. As in the 9th Observation so here the Bubble by transmitted light appeared of a contrary colour to that which it exhibited by reflexion. Thus when the Bubble being looked on by the light of the clouds reflected frōom it, seemed Red at its apparent circumference, if the clouds at the same time or very suddenly were viewed through it, the colour at its circumference would be blew. And on the contrary when by reflected light it appeared blew, it would appear Red by transmitted light. Obs: 21. By wetting Plates of Muscovy-glasse whose thinnesse made the like colours appear, the colours became more faint, especially by wetting the Plates on that side opposite to the eye; but I could not perceive any variation of their Species. So that the thicknesse of a Plate requisite to produce any colour depends only on the density of the Plate & not of the ambient medium. And hence by the 10th & 16th observations may be known the thicknesse of Bubbles of water or Plates of Moscovy-glasse, or of any other substances which they have at any colour produced by them. Obs: 22. A thin transparent body which is denser then its ambient medium, exhibits more brisk & vivid colours then that which is so much rarer; as I have particularly observed in Air & Glasse. For blowing glasse very thin at a lamp furnace, those Plates encompassed with Air did exhibit colours much more vivid then those of Air made thin between two glasses. Obs: 23. Comparing the quantity of light reflected frōom the severall Rings, I found it was most copious from the first or inmost, & in the exterior Rings became gradually lesse & lesse. Also the whitenesse of the first Ring wasstronger then that reflected frōom those parts of the were without the Rings; as I could manifest at distance the Rings made by the two colours comparing two Bubbles of water blown the first of which the whitenesse appeared lours, & the whitenesse which preceded 5551 Obs: 24. When the two object glasses were layd upon one another so as to make the Ringes of colours appear, though with my naked eye I could not discern above 8 or 9 of those Ringes yet by viewing them through a Prism I have seen a far greater multitude, in so much that I could number more then fourty, besides many others that were so very small & close together that I could not keep my eye so steddy on them severally as to number them. But by their extent I have sometimes estimated them to be more then a hundred. And I beleive the experiment may be improved to the discovery of far greater numbers. For they seem to be really unlimited, throough visible onely so far as they can be separated by the refraction, as I shall hereafter explain. But it was but one side of the Rings, namely that towards which the refraction was made , which by that refraction was rendered distinct, & the other side became more confused then to the naked eye, In so much that there I could not discerne above one or two, & sometimes none of those Rings, of which I could discern 8 or 9 with my naked eye. And their segments or arcs which on the other side appeared so numerous, for the most part exceeded not the third part of a circle. If the refraction was very great or the Prisms very distant from the Object-glasses, the middle part of those arcs became also confused so as to disappear & constitute an even whitenenesse, whilst on either side their ends, as also the whole arcs furthest from the center became distincter then before, appearing in the form you see them here designed. The arcs where they seemed distinctest were only white & black successively without any other colours intermixed. But in other places there appeared colours whose order was inverted by the refraction in such manner that if I first held the Prism very near the Object glasses & then gradually removed it farther of towards my eye, the colours of the 2d, 3d, 4th & following Rings shrunk towards the white that emerged between them untill they wholy vanished into it at the middle of the Arcs, & afterwards emerged again in a contrary order. But at the ends of the arcs they retained their order unchanged. I have sometimes so layd one Object-glasse upon the other that to the naked eye they have all over seemed uniformly white without the least appearance of any of the coloured Rings; & yet by viewing them through a Prism great multitudes of those Rings have Discovered themselves. And in like manner Plates of Moscovy-glasse & bubbles of glasse blown at a lamp-furnace which were not soe thin as to exhibit any colours to the naked eye, have through the Prism exhibited a great variety of them ranged irregularly up & down in the form of wWaves. And so bubbles of water before they began to exhibit their colours to the naked eye of a by stander have appeared through a Prism, girded about with many parallell & horizontal Rings: to produce which effect, it was necessary to hold the Prism parallel or very nearly parallel to the Horizon, & to dispose it so that the rayes might be refracted upwards. Having given my Observations of these colours before I make use of them to unfold the causes of the colours of naturall bodies, it is convenient that by the simplest of them, I first explain the more compounded, such as are the 2d, 3d, 4th, 59th, 12th, 18th, 20th, & 24th. And first to show how the colours in the 4th & 18th Observations are produced, let there be taken in any right line the lengths YZ, YA, & YH in proportion as 4, 9, & 14 & between ZA & ZH eleven mean proportionalls, of which let ZB be the second, ZC the third, ZD the fift, ZE the seventh, ZF the ninth, & ZG the tenth. And at the points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, let perpendiculars Aα, Bβ, &c. be erected, by whose intervalls, the extent of the severall colours set underneath against them, is to be represented. Then divide the line Aα in such proportion as the numbers 1, 2, 3; 5, 6, 7; 9, 10, 11; &c. set at the point of division denote. And through those divisions from Y draw lines 1J, 2K, 3L; 5M, 6N, 7O; &c Now if A2 be supposed to represent the thicknesse of any thin transparent body at which the utmost violet is most copiously reflected in the first Ring or series of colours, then by the 13th Observa sent its thicknesse at which the utmost Red 556 in the same series. Also by the 5t & 16th Observations HN will denote the thicknesses at which those extream colours are most copiously reflected reflected in the second series, & so on. And the thicknesse at which any of the intermediate colours are reflected most copiously will according to the 14th Observation, be defined by the intermediate parts of the lines 2K, 6N, &c against which the names of those colours are written below. But faurther to define the latitude of these colours in each Ring or series let A1 design the least thicknesse & A3 the greatest thicknesse at which the extream Violet in the first series is reflected, & let HJ & HL design the like limits for the extream Red, & the intermediate colours be limited by the intermediate parts of the lines 1J & 3L; against which the names of those colours are written. And in the second series let those limits of the lines 5M & 7O; & so on: But yet with this caution that the reflexions be supposed strongest at the intermediate spaces 2K, 6N, 10R &c & to decrease gradually towards these limits 1J,3L; 5M, 7O; &c on either side, where you must not conceive them to be precisely limited but to decay indefinitely. And wheras I have designassigned the same latitude to every series, I did it because although the colours in the first series seem to be a little broader then the rest by reason of a stronger reflexion there, yet that inequality is so insensible as scarcely to dbe determined by observation. Now according to this Description conceiving that the rayes in that severall colours in here are by turnes reflected at the spaces 1J, L3, 5MO7, 9PR11, &c; & transmitted at the Spaces AHJ1, 3LM5, 7OP9 &c; it is easie to know what colour must in the open Air be exhibited at any thicknesse of a transparent thin bBody. For if a Ruler be applyed parallel to AH, at that distance frōom it by which the distance thicknesse of the bBody is represented, the alternate spaces 1JL3, 5MO7 &c. which it crosseth will denote the reflected originall colours of which the colour exhibited in the open Air is compounded: Thus if the constitution of the Green in the third series of colours be desired; apply the Ruler as you see at π, ρ σ, φ, And by its passing through some off the Blew at π, & yellow at σ, as well as through the green ρ, you may conclude that green exhibited at that thicknesse of the body is principally constituted of originall green, but not without a mixture of some blew & yellow. By this meanes you may know how the colours frōom the water of the Rings outwards ought to succeed in order as they were described in the fourth & 18th observations. For if For if you move the Ruler gradually frōom AH through all distances, having past over the first space which denotes litthle or no reflexion to be made by thinnest substances, it will first arrive at the Violet & then very quickly at the Blew & green which together with that Violet compound Blew, & then at the yellow & Red by whose further addition that Blew is converted into whitenesse, which whitenesse continues during the transit frōom J to 3, & after that by the successive deficience of its component colours turnes first to compound yellow & then to Red, & last of all the Red ceaseth at L. Then begin the colours of the second series, which succeed in order between 5 & O, & are more lively then before because more expanded & severed And for the same reason instead of the former white there intercedes between the blew & yellow a mixture of Orange, Yellow, Green, Blew & Indico, all which together ought to exhibit a dilute & imperfect Green. So the colours of the third series all succeed in order; first the Violet which a little interferes with the Red of the second order & is thereby inclined to a reddish Purple; then theey blew & green which are lesse mixed with other colours & consequently more lively then before; especially the Green: Then followes the yellow some of which towards the Green is distinct & good, but that part of it towards the succeeding Red, as also that Red is mixed with the Violet & Blew of the fourth series whereby various degrees of Red very much inclining to Purple are compounded. The Violet & Blew which should succeed this Red being mixed with & hidden in it, there succeeds a Green, aAnd this at first is much inclined to blew, but soon becomes a good Green, the only unmixt & lively colour in this fourth series. For as it verges towards the yellow its begins to interfere with the colours of the fift series, by whose mixture the succeeding yellow & Red are very much diluted & made dirty, especially the yellow which being the weaker colour is scarce able to show it selfe. After this the severall series interfere more & more & their colours become more & more intermixed till after three or four more revolutions (in which the Red & blew predominate by turnes) all sorts of colours are in all places pretty equally blended & compound one eaven whitenesse. And since by the 15th Observation the rayes indued with one colour are transmitted where those of another clolour reason of the colours made by the transmitted Observations is also frōom hence evident. If not only the order & Species of these the precise thicknesse of the Plate of thin are exhibited, be defined in parts of an performed by performed by assistance of the 6t or 6th 5575532 For according to those observations the thicknesse of the thin Air which between two glasses exhibited the Orange as bright red of the 6th order was 114554 parts of an inch. Now suppose this thicknesse to be represented by Gτ & the eleventh part of it Gλ as will be about 1160000 of an inch. And so Gμ, Gν, Gζ, Gο, will be 3160000, 5160000, 7160000, & 9160000. And this being known it is easie to determine what thicknesse of Air is represented by Gφ or any other distance of the Ruler frōom AH. But further since by the 10th observation the thicknesse of Air was to the thicknesse of water which between the same glasses exhibited the same colour, as 4 to 3; & by the 21th observation the colours of thin Bodies are not varied by varying the ambient Medium; the thicknesse of a Bubble of water exhibiting any colour will be 34 of the thicknesse of Air producing the same colour. And so according to the same 10th &. 21th Observations the thicknesse of a Plate of glasse whose refraction is measured by the proportion of the series sines 31 to 20 may be 2031 of the thicknesse of Air producing the same colours. And the like of other Mediums. On these grounds I have composed the following Table wherin the thicknesse of Air, water, & glasse at which each colour is most intense & specific, is expressed in parts of an inch divided into ten hundred thousand equall parts.

To doe which let there be described a large Arc of a Circle, & a streight lines which may touch that Arc, & parallel to that Tangent severall occult lines at such distances frōom it as the numbers set against the severall colours in the Table denote. For the Arc & its Tangent will represent the suꝑperficies of the glasses terminating the interjacent Air, & the places where the occult lines cut the Arc will show at what distances frōom the center or point of contact each colour is reflected. There are also other uses of this Table: For biy its assistance the thicknesse of the Bubble in the 19th Observation was determined by the colours which it exhibited. And so the bignesse of the parts of naturall bodies may be conjectured at by their colours, as shall be hereafter shown. Also if two or more very thin Plates be layd one upon another so as to compose one Plate equalling them all in thicknesse, the resulting colour may be hereby determined. For instance, Mr Hook in his Moscovy Micrographia observes that a faint yellow plate of Moscovy glasse layd upon a blew one constituted a very deep purple. The yellow of the first order is a faint one, & the thicknesse of the plate exhibiting it according to the Table, is 514 to which add 912 the thicknesse exhibiting Blew of the second order, & the summe nearly approaching 1445 the thicknesse the third order. To explain in the next place the 2d & 3d Observations, that is, how these colours Prisms about their com̄mmon Axis the 558 that expressed in those Observations) may be converted into white & black Rings, & afterwards into colours again in an inverted order: it must be remembred that those colours are dilated by the obliquation of the rayes to the Air which intercedes the Glasses, & that according to the Table in the 7th Observation their dilatation or recession frōom their com̄mmon center is most manifest & speedy when they are obliquest. Now the rays of yellow being more refracted by the first suꝑperficies ofat the said Air then those of Red, are therby made more obli to the second suꝑperficies at which they are reflected to produce the coloured Rings, & consequently the yellow in each Ring will be more dilated then the Red; & the excesse of its dilatation will be so much the greater by how much the greater is the obliquity of the rayes, untill at last it become of equall extent with the Red of the same Ring. And for the same reason the Green, blew & Violet will be also so much dilated by the still greater obliquity of their rayes as to become all very nearly of equall extent with the Red, that is, equally distant frōom the center of the Rings. And then all the colours of the same series must be coincident, & by their mixture exhibit a White Ring. And these White Rings must have black or dark Rings between them because they doe not spread & interfere with one another as before. And for that reason also they must become distincter & visible to far greater numbers. But yet the Violet being obliquest will be something more dilated in proportion then the other colours, & so very apt to appear at the exterior verges of the white. Afterwards by a greater obliquity of the rays, the Violet & Blew become sensibly more dilated then the Red & yYellow, & so being further removed frōom the center of the Rings, the colours must emerge out of the white in an order contrary to that which they had before, the Violet & Blew at the exterior limbs, & the Red & yellow at the interior. And the Violet by reason of the greatest obliquity of its rayes being in proportion most of all expanded will soonest appear at the exterior limb of each White Ring & become more conspicuous then the rest. And the severall series of colours by their unfolding & spreading will begin again to interfere, & thereby render the Rings lesse distinct & not visible to soe great numbers. If instead of the Prisms the objectglasses be made use of the Rings which they exhibit become not white & distinct by the obliquity of the eye, by reason that the rayes in their passage pPassage through that Air which intercedesd the glasses are very nearly parallel to themselves when first incident on the glasses, & consequently those indued with severall colours are not inclined one more then another to that Air as it happens in the Prisms. There is yet another circumstance of these experiments to be considered, & that is why the black & white Rings which when viewed at distance appear distinct, should not only becom confused by viewing them near at hand, but also yeild a Violet colour at both the edges of every white Ring. And the reason is that the rayes which enter the eye at severall parts of the Pupill have severall obliquities to the glasses, & those which are most obli, if considered apart, would represent the Rings bigger then those which are the least oblique. Whence the breadth of the Perimeter of every white Ring is expanded outwards by the obliquest rays & inwards by the least oblique. And this expansion is so much the greater by how much the greater is the difference of the obliquity that is, by how much the Pupill is wider, or the eye nearer to the Glasses. And the breadth of the Violet must be most expanded, because the rayes apt to excite a sensation of that colour are most oblique to the second or further suꝑperficies of the thin'd Air at which they are reflected, & have also the greatest variation of obliquity, which makes that colour soonest emerge out of the edges of the white. And as the breadth of every Ring is thus augmented, the dark intervalls must be diminished, untill the neighbouring Rings become continuous, & are blended, the exterior first, & then those nearer the center, so that they can no longer be distinguished apart but seem to constitute an eaven & uniform whitenesse. Amongst all the Observations theire is none accompanied with so odd circūumstances as the 24th. Of those the Principall are that in thin Plates which to the naked eye seem of an eaven & uniform transparent whitenesse the refraction of a Prism should make the Rings of colours appear; wheras it usually makes Objects appear coloured onely where they are terminated with shadows, or have parts unequally luminous, & that it should make those Rings exceedingly distinct & white although it usually renders objects confused & coloured. The cause of these things you will understand, by considering that all the Rings of colours are actually really in the Plate when viewed with the although by reason of the great breadth of rency they so much interfere & are blended they seem to constitute an eaven whitenesse rayes passe through the Prism to the eye severall colours in every Ring are 5593 then others according to their degree of refrangibility which meanes the colours one one side of the Ring become more unfolded & dilated & on the other side more complicated & contracted. And where by a due refraction they are so much contracted that the severall Rings become narrower then to interfere with one another, they must appear distinct & also white if the constituent colors be so much contracted as to be wholy coincident. But on the other side where every Ring is made broader by the further unfolding of its colours, it must interfere more with other Rings then before & so become lesse distinct To explain this a little further, suppose the concentrick circles AB and CD represent the red & Violet of any order which together with the intermediate colours constitute any one of these Rings. Now these being viewed through a Prism the Violet circle BC will by a greater refraction be further translated from its place then the Red AD & so approach nearer to it on that side towards which the refractions are made. For instance, if the Red be translated to ad the Violet may be translated to bc so as to approach nearer to it at c then before, & if the Red be further translated to ad the Violet may be still so much further translated to bc as to convene with it at c, & if the Red be yet further translated to αδ, the Violet may be still so much further translated to βγ as to pass beyond it at γ & convene with it at e & f. And this being understood not only of the Red & Violet but of all the other intermediate colours, & also of every revolution of those colours, you will easily perceive how these of the same revolution or order by their nearnesse at cd & δγ & their coincidence at cd, e, & f ought to constitute pretty distinct arcs of circles, especially at cd or at e & f & that they will appear severall at at cd, at cd exhibit whitenesse by their coincidence, & again appear severall at δγ, but yet in a contrary order to that which they had before & still retain beyond e and f. But on the other side at ab, ab, αβ these colours must become much more confused by by being dilated & spread soe as to interfere with those of other orders. And the same confusion will happen at δγ between e & f if the refraction be very great, or the Prism very distant from the Object-Glasses. And these little Arcs must be distinctest & whitest at their middle, & at their ends, where in which case no parts of the Ring will be seen save only two little Arcs at e & f whose distance from one another will be augmented by removing the Prism still further from the Object-Glasses. And these little Arcs must be distinctest & whitest at their middle, & at their ends where they begin to grow confused, they must be coloured. And the colours at one end of every Arc must be in a contrary order the those at the other end, by reason that they crosse in the intermediate white. Namely their ends which verge towards δγ will be red & yellow on that side next the center & blew & Violet on the other side. But their other ends which verge from δγ will on the contrary be blew & Violet on that side towards the center & on the other side red & yellow. For confirmation of all this I need alledge no more than that it is mathematically demonstrable from my former Principles. But yet I shall add that they which please to take the pains, may by the Testimony of their senses be assured that these explications are not Hypotheticall but infallibly true & genuine. For in a dark Room by viewing these Rings through a Prism by reflextion of the severall Prismati colours which an Assistant causes to move to & fro upon a wall or paper from whence they are reflected, whilst the spectators eye, the Prism & Object-glasses (as in the 13 observation) are placed steddy: the position of the circles made successively by the severall colours will be found such in respect of one another as I have described at abcd, or abcd or αβγδ. And by the same Method, the truth of the explications ofthe other Observations, is to be examined. By what hath been said, the the like Bubbles & thin Plates of Glasse may be small fragments of those Plates there is servable, that if they lying flatt 556560 be turned about their centers whilst they are viewed through a Prism: some of them exhibit waves in one or two positions only, but the most of them do in all positions exhibit those waves & that for the most part appearing, almost all over the Glasse. The reason is that the suꝑperficies of such Plates are not eaven but have many cavities & swellings which how shallow soever do a little vary the thicknesse of the Plate: And by the severall sides osf those cavities there must be produced waves in severall postures of the Prism. Now though it be but some very small and narrow parts of the Glasse by which these waves for the most part are caused yet they may seem to extend themselves over the whole Glasse, because from the narrowest of those parts there are colours of severall orders confusedly reflected which by refraction of the Prism are unfolded & dispersed to severall places so as to constitute so many severall waves as there were divers orders of the colours promiscuously reflected from that part of the Glasse. These are the Principall Phænomena of thin Plates or Bubbles whose explications depend on the Properties of light that I have heretofore delivered: And these you see doe neccessarily follow from them & agree with them even to their very least circumstances; & not onely so, but doe very much tend to their proof. Thus by the 24th Observation it appears that the rayes of severall colours made as well by thin Plates or Bubbles as by the refractions of a Prism have severall degrees of refrangibility, whereby those of each order which at their reflexion from the Plate or Bubble are intermixed with those of other orders, are seperated from them by refraction, & associated together so as to become visible by themselves like Arcs of cCircles. For if the rayes were all alike refrangible, 'tis impossible that the whitenesse which to the naked sense appears uniform should by refraction have its parts transposed & ranged into those black & white Arcs. It appears also that the unequall refractions difform rayes proceed not from any contingent irregularities. Such as are V, an uneaven polish, or for fortuitous position of the pores of the Glasse; unequall motions in the Air or Æther. spreading spreading, breaking or dividing the same ray into many diverging parts; or the like. For admitting any such irregularities, it would be impossible for refractions to render those Rings so very distinct & well defined, as they doe in the 24th oObservation. It is necessary therefore that every ray have its proper & constant degree of refrangibility connate with it, according to which its refraction is ever justly & regularly performed; & that severall rayes have severall of those degrees. And what is said of their rRefrangibility may be also understood of their Reflexibility, that is of their dispositions to be reflected some at a greater & others at a lesse thicknesse of thin Plates or Bubbles, namely that those dispositions are also connate with the rayes & im̄mmutable, as may appear by the 13th 14th & 15th Observations compared with the 4th & 18th. By the precedent Observations it appears also that whitenesse is a dissimilar mixture of all colours, & that light is a mixture of rayes endewed with all those colours. For considering the multitude of the Rings of colours in the 3d, 12t, & 24th Observations, it is manifest that although in the 4th & 18th Observations there appear noe more than 8 or 9 of those Rings, yet there are really a far greater number which soe much interfere & mingle with onone another as after those 8 or 9 revolutions to dilute one another wholy & constitute an eaven & sensibly uniforme whitenesse. And consequently that whitenesse must be allowed a mixture of all colours, & the light which conveys it to the eye must be a mixture of rayes endewed with all those colours.This I beleive hath seemed the most paradoxical of all my assertions, & met with the most universall & obstinate prejudice; But to me it appears as infallibly true & certain, as it can seem extravagent to others. For hitherto I never tried any way toto mix all colours by which I could not in some degree or other produce whitenesse & yet I have made as many trialls as I could excogitate ways of mixing colours which I may take occasion to discourse But further by the 24th Observation it is a constant relation between colours & refrangible rayes being Violet, the least of intermediate colours having proportionally 557561 4refrangibility. And by the 13th, 14th, & 15th Observations compared with the 4th or 18th, there appears to be the same constant relation between colour & reflextibility, the Violet being on equall termes reflected at least thicknesse of any thin Plate or Bubble, the rRed at greatest thicknesse, & the intermediate colours at intermediate thicknesses. Whence ait followes that the colorifi dispositions of rayes are also connate with them & im̄mmutable, & by consequence that all the productions & appearances of colours in the world are derived not from any Physicall change caused in light by refraction or reflexion but only from the various mixtures or seperations of rayes by virtue of their different Refrangibility or Reflextibility. And in this respect it is that the science of colours becomes a speculation more proper for Mathematicians then naturalists, & deserves rather to be esteemed Mathematicall then Physicall, as I told you in my former letter, & may hereafter explain more fully. I am now come to the last part of this design which is to consider how the Phænomena of thin transparent Plates stand related to those of all other naturall bodies. Of these bodies I have already told you that they appear of divers colours accordingly as they are disposed to reflect most copious by the rayes endewed with those colours. But their constitutions wherby they reflect some more rayes more copiously then others, remaines to be enquired after. And this I shall endeavour in the following Propositions. Prop.1. Those superficies reflect the greatest quantity of light which have the greatest refracting power, that is, which intercede mediums that differ most in their refracting densities. And in the confines of equally dense mediums there is noe reflexton. The analogy between reflexion & refraction will appear by considering that when light passeth oblily out of one Medium into another which refracts from the perpendicular, the greater is the difference of their density the lesse obliquity is requisite to cause a totall reflexion; because as the sines are which measure the refraction, so is the sine of incidence at which the totall reflexion begins, to the radius of the circle, & consequently that incidence is least where there where there is the greatest difference of the sines. Thus in the passing of light out of water into Air where the refraction is measured by the ratio of the sines 3 to 4 the totall reflexion begins when the angle of incidence is sbout 48degr 35min. In passing out of Glasse into Air where the refraction is measured by the ratio of the sines 20 to 31 the totall reflexion begins when the angle of incidence is 40degr. 10min. And so in passing out of Chriystall or more strongly refracting Mediums into Air, there is still a lesse obliquity requisite to cause a totall reflexion. Superficies therfore which refract most do soonest reflect all the light which is incident on them, & so must be allowed most strongly reflective. But the truth of this Proposition will further appear by observing that in the superficies interceding any two of those Mediums, Air of water or other liquors, com̄mmon Glasse, Chrystall, & Metalline Glasses, the reflexion is stronger or weaker accordingly as the superficies hath a greater or lesse refracting power. Thus when other Mediums are contiguous to Air; the reflexion is stronger in the suꝑperficies of Glasse then of water; still stronger in the superficies of Chrystall, & strongest in the superficies of metalline Glasse. So in the confine of water & com̄mmon Glasse the reflexion is very weak, but yet stronger then in the confine of water & oyle or almost any other two liquors, & still stronger in the confine of water & Chrystall or Metalline Glasse: accordingly as those Mediums differ more or lesse in density. So in the confine of com̄mmon Glasse & Chrystall there is a weak reflexion & a stronger reflexion in the confine of com̄mmon & mealline Glasse. But in the confine of two Glasses of equall density, there is not any sensible reflexion as was shown in the 1st Observation. And the same may be understood of the superficies of two Chrystalls or liquors or any other substances in which no reflraction is caused. Whence it comes to passe that uniform Mediums have no sensible reflexion but in their externall superficies where they are adjacent to other Mediums of a different densiity. Prop: 2. The least parts of naturall bodies are in somemeasure transparent; And the opacity of those the multitude of reflexions caused caused in their That this is so will easily be granted been conversant with Microscopes. And562558 And it may be also tried by applying any substance to a hole through which some light is immitted into a dark room For how opake sooner that substance may bseem in the open Air, it will by that means appear very manifestly transparent if it be of a sufficient thinnesse. Onely metalline bodies must be exempted which by reason of their excessive density seem to reflect almost all the light incident on their first superficies. Prop: 3: Between the parts of opake or coloured bodies are many interstices replenished with mediums of other densities: as water between the tinging corpuscles wherwith any liquor is impregnated; Air between the aqueous globules that constitute Clouds or mists; & for the most part spaces void of both Air & water; but yet perhaps replenished with some subtiler Medium between the parts of hard bodies. The truth of this is evinced by the two precedent Propositions, For by the second Proposition there are many reflexions from the internall parts of bodies, which by the 1st Proposition would not happen if the parts of those bodies were continued without any such interstices between them, because reflexions are caused only in superficies which intercede Mediums of a differing density. But further that this discontinuity of parts is the Principall cause of the opacity of bodies will appear by considering that opake substances become transparent by filling their pores with any substance of equall or almost equall density with their parts. Thus paper dipped in water or oyle, the oculus mundi stone steeped in water, linnen cloth oyl'd or varnished, & many other substances soaked in such liquors as will intimately pervade their little pores become by that means more transparent then otherwise. So on the contrary the most transparent substances may by seperating their parts become rendered sufficiently opake, as Glasse by being reduced to powder or otherwise flawed, water by being formed into many small bubbles either alone in the form of froth, or by shaking it together with oyle of Turpentine or some other convenient liquor with which it will not incorporate, & Horn by being scraped. To To the increase of of the opacity of these bodies it conduces something that by the 23d Observation the reflexions of very thin transparent substances are considerably stronger then those made by the same substances are considerably of a greater thicknesse. And to the reflexion of solid bodies it may further add, that the interstices of their parts are void of Air. For that for the most part they are so is reasonable to beleive considering the ineptitude which Air hath to pervade small cavities as appears by the ascention of water in slender glasse pipes, paper, cloth & other such like substances whose pores are found too small to be replenished with Air, & yet large enough to admit water; & by the difficulty wherewith Air pervades the pores of a Bladder through which water finds ready passage. And according to the 11th Observation the cavities thisus void of Air will cause the same kind of effects as to reflexion which those doe that are replenished with it, but yet something more manifestly because the Medium in relation to refractions is rarest when most empty of Air as Mr Hook hath proved in his Micrographia. In which Book he hath also largely discoursed of this & precedent Proposition, & declined many other very excellent things concerning the colours of thin Plates & other naturall bodies which I have not scrupled to make use of so far as they were for my purpose. Prop: 4. The parts of bodies & their interstices must not be lesse then of some definite bignesse thickness to render them opake & coloured. For the opakest bodies if their parts be subtily divided (as Metalls by being dissolved in acid Menstruums, &c) become perfectly transparent. And you may also remember that in the 8th Observation there was no reflexion at the superficies of the Object-glasses where they were very near one another though they did not absolutely touch. And in the 17th Observation the water-bubble where it became thin insensible so as to cause the apparitions spots. 5635 On these grounds I conceive it is that water, salt, glasse, stones & such like substances are transparent For upon divers considerations they seem to be as porous as other bodies, but yet their pores & parts too small to cause any opacity. Prop: 5. The transparent parts of bodies according to their severall sizes must reflect rayes of one colour, & transmitt those of another, on the same grounds that thinne plates or Bubbles doe reflect or transmitt those rayes. And this I take to be the ground of all their colours. For If if a thin'd or plated body which being of an eaven thicknesse appeares all over of one uniform colour should be broken into fragments of the same thicknesse with the plate, I see noe reason why a heap of those fragments should not constitute a powder of the same colour which the Plates exhibited before it was broken. And the parts of all naturall bodies being like soe many fragments of a Plate must on the same grounds exhibit the same colours. Now that they doe soe will further appear by the affinity of their properties. As that the infusion of Nephritic wood & many other substances reflect one colour & transmitt another like thin bodies in the 9th & 20th Observations. That the colours of silks, cloths, & other substances which water or oyle can intimately penetrate become more faint & obscure by being im̄mmmerged in those liquors, & recover their vigor again by being dryed much after the manner declared of thin bodies in the 10th & 21 Observations. And that some of those coloured powders which Painters use may have their colours a little changed by being very elaborately & finely ground. Where I see not what can be justly pretended for those changes besides the breaking of their parts into lesse parts by that contrition after the same manner that the colour of a Plate is changed by varying its thicknesse. For which reason also it is that many flowers by being bruised become more transparent then before; or at least in in some degree or another change their colours. Nor is it much lesse to my purpose that by mixing divers liquors very odd & remarkable productions & changes of colours may be effected, of which no cause can be more obvious & naturall than that the saline corpuscles of one liquor do variously act upon or unite with the tinging corpuscles of another, so as to make them swell or shrink (whereby not only their bulk but their density also may be changed) or to divide them into smaller corpuscles, or make many of them associate into one cluster; For wee see how apt those saline Menstruums are to penetrate & dissolve substances to which they are applyed & some of them to precipitate what others dissolve. In like manner if wee consider the various Phæ nomena of the Atmoshphere, wee may observe that when vapours are first raised, they hinder not the transparency of the Air, being divided into parts too small to cause any reflectxion in their superficies. But when in order to compose drops of rain they begin to coalesce & constitute globules of all intermediate sizes, those globules when they become of a convenient size to reflect some colours & transmitt others, may constitute clouds of various clolours acording to their sizes. And I see not what can be rationally conceived in so transparent a substance as water for the production of these colours besides the various sizes of these its parcells, which seem to affect a globular figure most; but yet perhaps not without some instability in the smallest of them by reason that those are most easily agitated by heat or any trembling motions in the Air. Prop: 6. Then parts of Bodies on which their colours depend are denser then the medium which pervades the interstices. This will appear by considering that the colour body depends not only on the rayes which are pendicularly on its parts, but on those also dent at all other angles. And that 564559 7th Observation a very little variation of obliquity will change the reflected colour where the thinne body or small particle is rarer then the ambient Medium, in so much that such a small particle will at diversly oblique incidences reflect all sorts of colours in so great a variety that the colour resulting from them all confusedly reflected from a heap of such particles must rather be a white or grey then any other colour, or at best it must be but a very imperfect & dirty colour. Whereas if the thin Body or small particle be much denser then the ambient Medium, the colours according to the 19th Observation are so little changed by the variation of obliquity, that the rayes which are reflected least oblily, may predominate over the rest so much as to cause a heap of such particles to appear very intensly of their colour. It conduces also something to this Proposition that according to 22th Observation, the colours exhibited by the denser thin body within the rarer are more bris then those exhibited by the rarer within the denser. Prop: 7th. The bignesse of the component parts of naturall bodies may be conjectured by their colours. For since the parts of those bodies by pProp: 5 doe most probably exhibit the same colours with a plate of equall thicknesse, provided they have the same refractive density; & since their parts seem for the most part to have much the same density with water or glasse, as by many circumstances is obvious to collect: to determine the sizes of those parts you need only have recourse to the precedent Tables in which the thicknesse of water or Glasse exhibiting any colour is expressed. Thus if it be desired to the diameter of a corpuscle which being of equall density with glasse, shall reflect Green of the third order; the number 1712 showes it to be about 17 121000000 parts of an inch. The greatest difficulty is here to know of what order the colour the colour of any body is. And for this end wee must have recourse to the 4th & 18th Observations from whence may be collected these perticulars. Scarlets & other Reds, Oreanges & yellowes if they be pure & intense are most probably of the second order. Those of the first & third order also may be pretty good, only the Orange & Red of the third order have too great a mixture of Violet & Blew. There may be good Greens of the fourth order but the purest are of the third. And of this order the Green of all Vegetables seems to be, partly by reason of the intensnesse of their colours, & partly because when they wither some of them turn to a greenish yellow, & others to a more ꝑperfect yellow or Orange or perhaps to Red, passing first through all the aforesaid intermediate colours. which changes seem to be effected by the exhaling of the moisture which may leave the tinging corpuscles more dense, & something augmented by the accretion of the oyley & earthy part of that moisture. Now the Green without doubt is of the same order with those colours into which it changeth because the changes are graduall & those colours though usually not very pure yet for the most part are too pure & lively to be of the fourth order. Blewes & Purples may be either of the second or third order. But the best are of the third. Thus the colour of Violets seems to be of that order, because their syrrup by acid liquors turnes red and by urinous & alcalizate turn green. For since it is of the nature of acids to dissolve or attenuate, & of Alcalies to precipitate or incrassate, if the purple colour of the syrrup was of the second order, an acid liquor by attenuating its tinging corpuscles would change it to Red of the first order, & an Alcaly by incrassate them would change it to a green of the second red & Green, especially the Green, seem be the colours produced by these changes 5656 But if the said purple be supposed of the third order its change to red of the second & green of the third may without any inconvenience be allowed. If there be found any body of a deeper & lesse reddish purple then that of Violets its colour most probably, is of the second order. But yet there being no body com̄mmonly known whose colour is constantly more deep then theirs, I have made use of their na name to denote the deepest & least reddish Purples, such as manifestly transcend their colour in purity. The Blew of the first Order though very faint & little, may possibly be the colour of some substances. And perticularly the Azure colour of the skys seems to be of this order. For all vapors when they begin to condense & coalesce into small parcells, become first of that bignesse whereby such an Azure must be reflected before they can constitute clouds of other colours. And so theis being the first colour which vapors begin to reflect, it ought to be the colour of the finest & most transparent skys in which vapors are not arrived to that grossnesse requisite to reflect other colours as we find it is by experience. Whitenesse if it be intense is either that in the first order of colours, of which sort perhaps is the colour of white lead; or else it is a mixture of those succeeding the third or fourth order, such as is the colour of paper, linnen, & most white substances. If corpuscles of various sizes exhibiting the colours of the second & third order be mixed, they should rather constitute an imperfect whitenesse or Grey of which I have already spoken. But yet it seems not impossible for them to exhibit an intense whitenesse if they be disposed to transmitt all the light which they reflect not, & do not retain & stifle much of it. For thus I told you that froth at a distance hath appeared very white & yet near at hand the severall Bubbles of which it was constituted were seen tinged all over with Rings of colours of the four or five first orders. Lastly for the production of Black the corpuscles must be lesse then any of those which exhibit colours. For at all greater sizes there is too much light reflected to constitute this colour. But if they be supposed a little lesse then is requisite to reflect the blew of the first order they will according to the 4th , 8th, 17th, & 18th Observations reflect so very little light as to appear intensely black, & yet may perhaps variously reflect refract it to & fro within themselves so long untill it happen to be stifled & lost, Bby which meanes they will appear black in all positions of the eye without any transparency. And from hence may be understood why Fire & the more subtile dissolver Putrefaction turne substances to black; why small quantities of black substances impart their colour very freely & intensely to other substances to which they are applied;* why Glasse ground very elaborately with sand together with what is worn of from the glasse & Copper become very black; why black substances doe on a Copper plate till it be well polished makes the sand together with what is worne off from the Glasse, & copper become very black; why black substances do soonest of all others become hot & burne, which effect may proceed partly from the multitude of refractions in a little room, & partly from the very easie commotion of so very small corpuscles; & why blacks are usually a little inclined to a blewish colour. For that they are so may be seen by illuminating white paper by reflextion from black substances, which will usually appear of a blewish white. And the reason is that black bodies on the obscure blew of the first order, as described in the 18th Observation, whence the corpuscles of black substances are most apt to reflect that colour. In these descriptions I have been the more popular because I hope its not impossible but that Microscopes will may be improved to the discovery of corpuscles which their colours depend. For if those be so far improved as with sufficient represent objects five or six hundred 566 then at a foot distance they appear to our naked eyes I should hope that wee might be able to discover some of the greatest of those corpuscles. And by one that would magnifie three or four thousand times perhaps they might all be discovered but those which produce blacknesse. In the mean while I see nothing material that rationally can be doubted of excepting this Position,. That transparent corpuscles of the same thicknesse & density with a Plate, do exhibit the same colour. And this I would have understood not without some latitude, as well because those corpuscles may be of irregular figures, & many rayes must be oblily incident, & so have a shorter way through them then the length of their diameter, as because the straitnesse of the Medium pent in on all sides may a little alter its motions or other qualities on which the reflexion depends. But yet I cannot much suspect the last because I have observed of some small plates of Moscovy-Glasse which were of an eaven thicknesse, that through a Microspcope they have appeared of the same colour at their edges & corners where included the Medium was terminated, which they appeared of in other places. However it willwould add much to our satisfaction if those corpuscles can be discovered with Microscopes, which if wee shall at length ever attain to I fear it will be the utmost improvement of this sense. For it seems impossible to see the more secret & noble works of Nature within those corpuscles by reason of their transparency. This may suffice concerning the constitution of naturall bodies on which their colours depend. But for further understanding the nature of reflexions I shall add these two following Propositions. Prop: 8. The cause of rReflexion is not the impinging of light on the solid & impervious parts of bodies, as is com̄mmonly supposed. This will appear by the following consideration First that in the passage of light out of glasse into Air theirre is a reflexion as strong or stronger then in its passage out of Air into Glasse & by many degrees stronger then in its passage out of Glasse into water. And it seems not probable that Air should have more reflecting parts then water or Glasse. But if that should possibly be supposed it will availe nothing: for the reflexion is as strong if not . perhaps stronger when the Air is drawn away from the Glasse, (suppose in the Air-Pump invented by Mr Boyle) as when it is adjacent to it. Secondly, if light in its passage out of Glasse into Air be incident more oblily then at an angle of 40 or 41 degrees it is wholly reflected, if lesse obliquely it is in great measure transmitted. Now it is not to be imagined that light at one degree of obliquity should meet with pores enough in the Air to transmitt the greater part of it, & at another degree of obliquity meet with nothing but parts to reflect it wholly: especially considering that in its passage out of Air into Glasse, how oblique soever be its incidence it finds pores enough in the Glass to transmitt the greatest part of it; If any man suppose that it is not reflected by the Air but by the utmost superficiall parts of the Glasse, there is still the same difficulty: besides that such a supposition is unintelligible, & will also appear to be false by applying water behind some part of the Glasse instead of Air. For so in a convenient obliquity of the rayes suppose of 45 or 46 degrees at which they are all reflected where the Air is adjacent to the Glasse, they shall be in great measure transmitted where the water is adjacent to it: which argues that their reflexion or transmission depends on the constitution of the Air & water. hind the glass, & not on the parts of the glass Thirdly if the colours made by a Prism placed at the of a beam of light into a darkned Room cast on a second Prism placed at a the former, in such manner that they incident upon it: the second Prism 597567 to the incident rayes that those which are of a blew colour shall be all reflected by it, & yet those of a red colour pretty copiously transmitted. Now if the reflexion be caused by the parts of Air or Glasse I would ask why at the same obliquity of incidence the blew should wholly impinge on those parts so as to be all reflected & yet the red find pores enough to be in great measure transmitted. Fourthly where two Glasses touch one another there is no sensible reflexion as was declared in the 1st Observation; & yet I see no reason why the rayes should not impinge on the parts of Glasse when contiguous to one another Glasse as much as when contiguous to Air. Firstly when the top of a water-Bubble (in the 17th Observation) by the continuall subsiding & exhaling of the water grew very thin there was such a little & almost insensible quantity of light reflected from it that it appeared intensly black, wheras round about that black spot where the water was thicker the reflexion was soe strong as to make the water seem very white. Nor is it onely at the least thicknesse of thin Plates or Bubbles that there is no manifest reflexion but at many other thicknesses continually greater & greater. For in the 15th Observation the rayes of the same colour were by turnes transmitted at one thicknesse & reflected at another thicknesse for an indeterminate number of successions. And yet in the suꝑperficies of the thin'd body where it is of any one thicknesse there are as many parts for the rayes to impinge on, as where it is of any other thicknesse. Lastly if reflexion were caused by the parts of reflecting bodies it would be impossible for thin Plates or Bubbles at the same place to reflect the rayes of one colour & transmitt those of another as they do according to the 13 & 15 Observations. For it is not to be īimmagined that at one place the rayes which for instance exhibit a blew colour should have the fortune to dash upon the parts & those which exhibit a Red to let upon the Pores Pores of the body; & then at another place soe the Body is either a little thicker, or a little thinner that on the contrary the Blew should hit upon its pores & the Red upon its parts. Prop: 9. 'Tis most probable that the rayes which impinge on the solid parts of any body, are not reflected but shifted & lost in that body. This is consentaneous to the Precedent Proposition & will further appear by considering that if all the rayes should be reflected which impinge on the internall parts of clear water or Chrystall, those substances should rather have a cloudy then so very clear transparency. And further there would be no Principle of the ob obscurity or blacknesse which some bodies have in all positions of the eye. For to produce this effect it is necessary that many rayes be retained & lost in the body & it seems not probable that any rayes can be stopt & retained in it which do not impinge on its parts. If you now ask how rayes are reflected without impinging on the parts of a body, & how those which impinge on its parts may be stopped & shifted, it requires an Hypothesis to explain it by, the description of which is besides my design. And so the manner how severall rayes are unequally refrangible & reflecxtible & originally indued with severall colours remains to be explained Hypothetically. But I shall content my selfe in having shown that de facto the rayes rayes of light are indued with those properties. Sir I am Your humble servant Isaac Newton.",NATP00127,1675-01-01 00:00:00

Read Novr: 18: 75.Entd LB. 7. 275.Pr. Trans. 121. Sir When you shewed me Mr Line's second Letter, I remember I told you, that I thought an answer in writing would be insignificant because the dispute was not about any ratiocination, but my veracity in relating an experiment, which he denies will succeed as it is described in my printed letters: For this is to be decided not by discourse, but new tryall of the experiment. What it is that imposes upon Mr Line I cannot imagin, but I suspect he has not tryed the experiment since he acquainted himself with my Theory, but depends upon his old notions taken up before he had any hint given to observe the figure of the coloured image. I shall desire him therefore, before he returns any answer, to try it once more for his satisfaction & that according to this manner. Let him take any Prism & hold it so that its axis may be perpendicular to the suns rays, & in this posture let it be placed as close as may be to the hole through which the sun shines into a dark room, which hole may be about the bigness of a pease. Then let him turn the Prism slowly about its axis & he shall see the colours move upon the opposite wall first towards that place to which the sun's direct light would pass if the Prism were taken away & then back again. When they are in the middle of these two contrary motions, that is when they are nearest that place to which the sun's direct light would p ray tends, there let him stop, for then are the rays equally refracted on both sides the Prism. In this posture of the Prism let him observe the figure of the colours & he shal find it not round as he contends, but oblong & so much the more oblong as the angle of the Prism, comprehended by the refracting plains, is bigger & the wall on which the age is colours are cast, more distant from the Prism: After this the colours red, yellow, green, blew, purple succeeding in order not from one side of the figure to the other as in Mr Line's conjecture, but from one end to the other. After & the length of the figure being not parallel but transvers to the axis of the Prism. After this manner I used to try the Tttt 4 502Experiment; For I have try'ded it often; sometimes to observe the circumstances of it, sometimes in order to further experiments & sometimes to show it to others, & in all my tryals the success was the same. But whereas Mr Line thinks I tryed it in a cloudy day & placed the Prism at a great distance from the hole of the window: the experiment will not succeed well if the day be not cleare & the Prism placed close to the hole, or so neare at least that all the sun's light that comes from the hole may pass through the Prism also, also, so as to appear in a round form if intercepted by a paper immediately after it has past the Prism. When Mr Line has tryed this I could wish he would proceed a little further to try that which I calld the Experimentum Crucis, seing (if I misremember not) he denies that as well as the other. For when he has tryed them (which by his denying them I know he has not done yet as they should be tryed) I presume he will rest satisfied. Three or four days after you gave me a sight of Mr Line's second Letter, I remember I thereupon showd the first of these two experiments to that Gentleman whom you found with me when you gave me that visit: & whilst I was showing it to him, Mr Hill . . . . A. H. (a member of the R. Society,) whom you are well acquainted with, came in & I showed it to him also. And you may remember, that Mr Hook R. H. R. H. D. two or three years agoe in a letter read before the R. Society, & transmitted to me, gave testimony not only to the Experiments questioned by Mr Line, but to all those set down in my first Letter about cColours, as having tryed them himself; & when you read Mr Line's letter at a meeting of the said Society, & was pleasd to do me the favour to ppropound the Experiment to be tryed in their presence, Mr Hook R. H. spake of it to them as a thing not to be questiond. But if it have not yet been tryed before them, & any of them, upon Mr Line's confidence, doubt of it, I promise when I shall have the happines to be at any more of their Assemblies, upon the least hint, to show them the tryal of it; & I hope, I shall not be troublesome, because it may be tryed (though not so perfectly) even without darkning a room, or the expence of any more time then half a quarter of an hower; although, if Mr Line persist in his denyal of it, I could wish it might be tryed sooner there, than I shall have an opportunity to enjoy be among them. I have returnd you Mr Line's letter. It came to my hands but this week the Gentleman by whom you sent it having not yet been at Cambridge but transmitting it to me from Oxford. I had some thoughts of writing a further discours about colours to be read at one of your Assemblies, but find it yet against the grain to write put pen to paper any more on that subject. But however I have one discourse by me of that subject written when I sent my first letters to you about colours & of which I then gave you notice. This you may command when you think it will be convenient if the custome of reading weekly discourses still continue. In the meane while I am Sir Your humble Servant Is. Newton.

An ancient Gentleman I met at one of your Assemblies (whose name I cannot recollect,) being thick of hearing desired me to inquire after the form of Mr Mace's Otocousticon a Musitian here; but he has not been in town since I came from London, but is somewhere in London about printing a book of Musiue.

Sir I have sent you the papers I mentioned, by Iohn Stiles. Vpon reviewing them I find somethingssome things so obscure as might have deserv'd a further explication by schemes, & some other things I gues will not be new to you though almost all was new to me when I wrote them. But as they are I phope you will accept of them though not worth the ample thanks you sent. I remember in some discourse with Mr Hook I happend to say that I thought light was reflected not by the parts of glas, water, air or other sensible bodies, but by the same confine or superficies of the æthereal Mediums, which refracts it, the rays finding some difficulty to get through it in passing out of the rarer denser into the denser rarer Medium, & a greater difficulty in passing out of the rarer into the densetr; & so being either refracted or reflected by that superficies, as the circumstances, they happend to be in at their incidence, make 'em able or unable to get through it. And for confirmation of this I said further, that I thought the reflexion of light at its tending out of glas into air would not be diminisht or weakend by drawing away the air in an aAir-Pump, as it ought to be if they were the parts of air that reflected. And added that I had not tryed this Experiment, but thought he was was not unacquainted with notions of this kind. To which he replyed that the notion was new & he would the first opportunity try the experiment I propounddpropounded But upon reviewing the papers I send you, I found it there set down for tryed; which makes me recollect that about the time I was writing those papers I had occasionally observ'd in an Air-pump here at Christs College, that I could not perceive the reflexion of the inside of the glas diminished in drawing out the Air. This I thought fit to mention least my former forgetfulnes through haveing long laid aside thoughts on these things, should seem to make me seem to have set down for certain what I never tryed Sir I had formerly purposed never to write any Hypothesis of light and colours, fearing it might be a means to ingage me in vain disputes: but I hope a declard resolution to answer nothing that looks like a controversy (unles possibly at my own time upon some other by occasion) may defend me from that fear. And therefore considering that such an Hypothesis would much illustrate the papers I send you promisd to send you & having a little time this last week to spare: I have not scrupled to describe one so far as I could on a sudden recollect my thoughts about it, not concerning my self whaether it shall be thought probable or improbable so it do but render the papers I send you and others sent formerly more intelligible. You may see by the scratching & interlining 'twas done in hast & I have not had time to get it transcribd, which makes me say I reseverreserve a liberty of adding or altering it, & desire that you would return those & the other papers when you have done with them. I doubt there is too much to be read at one time but you'le soon know how to order that The Hypothesis of these expe do but And At the end of the Hypothesis you'l see a paragraph to be inserted as is there directed; I should have added another or two but I had not time.

Sir The notice you gave me of the Royal Societie's intending to see the experiment of glass rubb'drubbed to cause various motions in bits of paper underneath, put me upon recollecting my self a little further about it, & then remembring that if one edge of the brass hoop was laid downward the glass was as neare again to the table as it was when the other edge was laid downward & that the papers plaid best when the glass was nearest to the table: I began to suspect that I had set down a greater distance of the glas from the table then I should have done, for in setting down that experiment I trusted to the Idea I had of the bignes of the hoop in which I might easily be mistaken having not seen it of a long time. And this suspicion was increased by trying the experiment with an object glass of a Telescope placed about the 3d part of an inch from the Table: for I could not see the papers play any thing neare so well as I had seen them formerly. Whereupon I lookt for the old hoop with its' glas, & at length found the hoop the glass being gone, but by the hoop I perceiv'dperceived that when one edge was turnd down the glas was almost the third part of an inch from the table & when the other edge was down which made the papers play so well the glass was scarce the 8th part of an inch from the Table. This I thought fit to signify to you that if the experiment succeed not well at the distance I set down it may be tryed at a less distance, & that you may alter my paper & write in it an eighth part of an inch instead of 12 or 13 of an inch. The bits of paper ought to be very little & of thin paper. Perhaps Perhaps little bits of the wing of a fly or other light substances may do better then paper. Some of the motions as that of hanging by a corner & twirling about, & that of leaping from one side of part of the glas to the another without touching the table happen but seldom but it made me take the more notice of them. Pray present my humble service to Mr Boyle when you see him & thanks for the favour of the convers I had with him at spring. My conceit of trapanning the common Ether, as he was pleasd to expres it, it makes me begin to have the better thoughts on that he was pleasd to entertein it with a smile. I am apt to think that when he has a set of experiments to try in his air pump, it will he will make that one to see how the compression or relaxation of a muscle will shrink or swell, soften or harden, lengthen or shorten it. As for Registring the two discourses you may do it, only I desire you would suspend till my next letter, in which I intend to set down something to be altered & something to be added in the Hypothesis, being in the mean while Sir Your humble Servant Is.

Mr Newton to Mr Oldenburg containing a more particular direction for trying the Experiment of glas rubbed to cause various motions, mention'dmentioned in his former letter of Dec. 14. 1675. SirDec. 21. 1675. Upon your letter I took another glas 4 inches broad & 14 of an inch wide thick, of such glas as Telescopes are made of & placed it a 16 part of an inch from the Tapble. It was set in such a piece of wood as the object glasses of Telescopes use to be set in. And the experiment succeeded well. After the rubbing was still & all was still the motion of the papers would continue sometimes while I counted a hundred, every paper leaping up about 20 times more or les & down as often. I tryed it also with two other glasses that belong to a Telescope & it suceeded with both, & I make no question but any glas will do that be excited to electric virtue as I think any may. If you have a mind to any of these glasses you may have them but I suppose if you cannot make it do in other glas you will faile in any I can send you. I am apt to suspect the failure was in the manner of rubbing: for I have observd that the rubbing variously or with various things alters the case. At one time I rub'drubbed the afforesaid great glass with a napkin twice as much as I used to do with my gown & nothing would stir, & yet presently rubbing it with something els the motions soon began. After the glass has been much rubd too, the motions are not so lasting, & the next day I found the motions fainter & difficulter to excite then the first. If the Society have a mind to attempt it any more, I can give no other better advice then this: To take a new glass not yet rub'drubbed (perhaps one of the old ones may do well enough after it has lain still a while,) & let this be rub'drubbed not with linnen nor soft nappy woollen but with stuff whose threds may rake the surface of the glass, suppose Tamerine or the like doubled up in the hand, & this with a brisk motion as may be till a hundred or 150 may be counted, the glass lying all the while over the papers, then if nothing stirr rub the glas with your finger ends half a score times to & fro or knock it as of with your finger ends as oft upon the glas; for this rubbing or knocking with your fingers, after the former rubbing, conduces most to excite the papers. If nothing stir yet, rub again with the cloth till 60 or 80 may be counted & then rub or knock again with your fingers, & retpeat this till the electric virtue of the glass be so far excited as to take up the papers, & then a very little rubbing or knocking now & then will revive the motions. In doing all this let the rubbing be always done as nimbly as may be, & if the motion be circularscircular like that of glas grinders it may do better. But if you cannot make it yet succeed, it must be let alone till I have some opportunity of trying it before you. As for the suspicion of the papers bein moved by the air I am secure from that. Yet in the other of drawing leaf gold to above a foot distance, I could not make it which I never went about to try my self till the last week, I suspect the Air might raise the gold & then a small attraction might determin it toward the glas. For I could not make it succeed. As for Mr Hook's insinuation that the summ of the Hypothesis I sent you had been delivered by him in his Micrography, I need not be much concerned at the liberty he takes in that kind. Yet because you think it may do well if I state the difference I take to be between them, I shal do it as briefly as I can, & that the rather that I may avoyd the savour of having done any thing unjustifiable or unhansome towards Mr Hooke. But for this end I must first (to see what is his) cast out what Mr Hooke he has borrowed from Des Cartes: or others viz: That there is an æthereal Medium. That light is the action of this Medium; That this Medium is less implicated in the parts of solid bodies & so moves more freely in them & transmits light more readily through them & that after such a manner as to accelerate the rays in a certain proportion. That refraction arises from this acceleration & has sines proportional. That light is at first uniform. That its colours are some disturbance or new modification of its rays by refraction or reflexion, That the colours of a Prism are made by the action means of the quiescent Medium accelerating some motion of the rays on one hand side where red appears & retarding it where on the other side where blew appears, & that there are but these two original colours or colour-making modifications of light, which by their various degrees, or, as Mr Hook call's it, dilutings, produce all intermediate ones. This rejected, the remainder iof his Hypothesis is that he has changed Des-Cartes pressing or progressive motion of the Medium to a vibrating one, the rotation of the globuli to the obliquation of pulses, & the accelerating that their rotation of the globuli on the one hand & retarding it on the other by the quiescent Medium to produce colours, to the like action of the Medium on the two ends of his pulses for the same end. TAnd having thus far modified his by the Cartesian Hypothesis he has added extended it further to explicate the phænomena of thin plates & added another explication of the colours of natural bodies fluid & solid. This I think is in short the summ of his Hypothesis & in all this I have nothing common with him but the supposition that æther is a vibrating Medium susceptible of vibrations of which supposition I make a very different use: he supposing it light it self & I using it which I suppose it is not. This is as great a difference as is between him & Des Cartes. But besides this the manner of refraction & reflexion & the nature & production of colours in all cases (which takes up the body of my discours) I explain very differently from him; & even in the colours of thin transparent substances I explain every thing after a way so differing from him, that the experiments I grownd my discours on destroy all he has said about them, & the two main experiments without which the manner of the production of those colours is not to be found out, he was were not only unknown to him when he wrote his Micrography, but even last spring, as I understood in mentioning them to him. This therefore is the sum of what's common to us, that there are æther may vibrate, & so if he think fit to use that notion of colours arising from the various bignes of pulses (without which his Hypothesis will do nothing) his will borrow as much from my answer to his OjectionsObjections as that I sent you does from his Micrography. But it may be he means that I have made use of his Observations & of some I did; as that of the inflexion of rays, for which I quoted him; that of opacicityopacity arising from the intterstices of the parts of bodies, which I insist not on; & that of plated bodies exhibiting colours, a Phænomenon for the notice of which I thank him: But he left me to find out & make such experiments about it as might inform me of the 47 manner of the production of those colours, to ground an Hypothesis on; he having given no further insight into it then this that the colour depended on some certain thicknes of the plate: though what that thicknes was at every colour he confesses he ha in his Micrographia he had attempted in vain to learn & therefore seing I was left to measure it my self I suppose he will allow me to make use of what I tooke the pains to find out. And this I hope may vindicate me from the expectation what Mr Hook has been pleasd to charge me with.

Sir ConcrningConcerning the Experiment of the glas & papers I should add these two to the former directions. One that the glas be rubd with a full handfull of stuff which may cover & rub all the glas at once: for thus its' electric vertue will be more easily & vigorously excited then if rub'd with a little only doubled up but once or twice. This rubbing with the stuff I suppose rarefies & diffuses the electric effluvia from the glas into the air, & the knocking or rubbing with the finger ends puts the diffused effluvia into irregular motions: The other thing I would note is that the papers may perhaps be too little as well as too great. Too small ones will be apter to stick to the glas or table. If the Experiment be tryed with a glas three or four inches broad set about 16 of an inch from the table, & the papers of a thin sort of paper cut into triangular pieces, the sides of those triangesles may not unfitly be about the 20th or 25t part of an inch, more or less. It may be best tryed with bits of several sizes put in at once, & if there be put in a piece or two of the wing of a fly, those, I find, will move more easily though scarce so variously. These & the former directions observed, I cannot imagin how you should miss, though I cannot promis al things will appear justly to you as they did to me, there being unaccountable circumstances which may make a difference. I am obliged to you Sir for your candor in acquainting me with Mr Hook's insinuations. It's but a reasonable piece of justice I should have an opportunity to vindicate my self from what may be undeservedly cast on me: & therefore since you have been pleased to be my representative there, & I have no means of knowing what's done but by you, I hope you will continue that equitable candor; though the b I think the present buisines of no great moment as to me, not imagining that the Royal Society are to be imposed on in a thing so plain, or that Mr Hook himself will persist in mistake when he hears the difference stated. The only thing I said he could pretend taken from his Hypothesis was the disposition of æther to vibrate, & yet whilst he grasps at all he is likely to fall short of this too. That light consists of æthereal vibrations are light is his; but that æther may vibrate (which is all I suppose) is to be had from a higher fountain: for that æther is a finer degree of air & air a vibrating Medium are old notions & the principles I go upon. I desire Mr Hook to shew me therefore, I say not the only the summ of the Hypothesis I wrote, which is his insinuation, but any part of it taken out of his Micrographia: but then I expect too that he instance in what's his own. It's most likely he'l pretend I had from him the application of vibrations to the solution of the Phænomena of thin plates: & yet all the use I make of vibrations is to strengthen or weaken the reflecting power of the æthereal superficies, which is so far from being in his Micrographia, that the last Spring when I told him of the reflecting power of the æthereal superficies, he took it for a new notion, having till then supposed that light to be reflected by the parts of gross bodies onely, such as are air, tinder, glas . To the things that he has from Des Cartes, pray add this, that the parts of solid bodies have a vibrating motion least he should say I had from him what I say about heat. And his having from Des Cartes the reduction of all colours to two you may if need be explain further for me thus That as Des Cartes puts every globulus to be urged forward on one side by the illuminated Medium & impeded on the other by the dark one, so Mr Hook puts every vibration to be promoted at one end & retarded at the other by those Mediums, & thence both alike derive two modifications of light on the two sides of the refracted beam for the production of all colours. Philosophical Transactions N. 121. p. 503. By Mr Gascoin's letter one might suspect that Mr Linus triyed the experiment some other way then I did, & therefore I shall expect till his friends have tried it according to my late directions: in which trial it may possibly conduce to be a further guidance to 'em to acquaint 'em that the Prism casts from it several papers images. One is that oblong one of colours which I mean & this is made by two refractions only. Another there is, made by two refractions & an intervening reflexion, & this is round & colourless if the angles of the Prism be exactly equal, but if the angles at the reflecting base be not equal it will be coloured, & that so much the more by how much unequaller the angles are, but yet not much unround unles the angles be very unequal. A third image there is made by one single reflexion & this is always round & colourles. The only danger is in mistaking the second for the first. But they are distinguishable not only by the length & lively colours of the first, but by its' different motion too: for whilst the Prism is turned continually the same way about its' axis, the second & third move swiftly, & go always on the same way till they dissappear, but the first moves slow & grows continually slower till it be stationary & then turns back again & goes back faster & faster till it vanish in the place where it began to appear. If before they without darkning their Room they "" hold the prism at their window in the sun's open light in such a posture that "" its' axis be perpendicular to the sun beams & then turn it about its' axis, they "" cannot miss of seing the first image: which having found, let them proceed to darken "" their room they may double up a paper once or twice, & make a round hole "" in the middle of it about 12 or 34 of an inch broad, & hold the paper immedi"" ately before the Prism being stayed & held steddy in that posture which makes the "" image stationary that the sun may shine on the Prism through that hole; & the "" Prism being stayed & held steddy in that posture which makes the image stationary, if "" the image then fall directly on an opposite wall, or on a sheet of paper placed "" at the wall suppose 15 or 20 foot from the prism or further off, "" they will see that image in such an oblong figure as I have described, with the red at "" one end, the violet at the other & a blewish green in the middle; & if they ob"" scure their Room as much as thyey can by drawing curtains or otherwise, it "" will make the colours so much the more conspicuous. This direction I have set down that no body into whose hands a Prism shall fall happen may find difficulty or trouble in trying it. But when Mr Linus's friends have tryed it thus, they may proceed to repeat it in a dark room with a less hole made in their window shut. And then I shal desire that they will send you a full & clear description how they tryed it, expressing the length breadth & angles of the Prism, its position to the incident rays & to the window shut, the bignes of the hole in the shut through which the sun shined on the Prism, what side of the Prism the sun shined on & at what side the light came out of it again, the distance of the Prism from the opposite paper or wall on which the refracted light was cast perpendicularly, & the length breadth & figure of the space there illuminated by that light, & the situation of each colour within that figure: & if they please to illustrate their description with a scheme or two it will make the buisines plainer. By this means if there be any difference in our way of experimenting, I shall be the better enabled to discern it & give 'em notice of it where the failure is & how to rectify it. I should be glad too if they would favour me with a description of the Experiment as it has been hitherto tryed by Mr Linus, that I 49. may have an opportunity to consider what there is in that which makes against me. And because Mr Gascoin seems to suspect that my directions sent Mr Linus may differ from what I have printed, I desire also that he would signify wherein he thinks they may differ so as to need reconciling. Fuller they are, but not different, nor any other then I have followed these above these seven years. As for my suspicion that Mr Linus might possibly rely on old Experiments, his quoting Sir Kenelm Digby for a By-stander might have made any other stranger to his way suspect it as well as I me suspect it: but I wonder most at his Mr Gascoin's insinuation as if I influenced the Press in what concerns Mr Linus & me. You know Sir I never spake nor hinted a syllable to you concerning printing or not printing any thing of Mr Linus, nor so much as knew of the printing his first letter till I saw it was out in the Transactions. When you sent it to me I out of a great desire to avoid controversies (which as you know I had enterteined long before) wrote back to you that I had no mind to meddle with it: but as I was ready to sealing that letter, I added a Post-script to this purpose: That seing Mr Linus was designing somthing about light for the Pres, to prevent publishing his mistake you might if you thought fit signify to him (but not from me) that the Experiment was tryed otherwise then he suggested & that in such & such respects which I there named. And the substance of this Postscript was that you published at the end of his first letter on which Mr Gascoin here animadverts, but was so far from being designd for the Press by me, that the first sight of it together with his letter in the Transactions made me say to one, that I wisht they had been supprest for I doubted the printing them would make Mr Linus unquiet & so in the end create me trouble. As for his 2d letter which you shewed me at Londōon I returnd it again to you so soon as I had read it & never saw it since, persisting in my desire to avoid the controversy. And at my returning it you moved me for an answer with this argument that if I wavd it Mr Linus was like to make the more stir: to which I replied that the buisines being about matter of fact was not proper to be decided by writing but by trying it before competent witnesses. Whereupon at your motion I told you what was requisite, & by your procurement preparations were accordingly made for it's tryall at the next Assembly of the Royal Society as I Mr Hook I understood by Mr Hook: But the day provd cloudy & before another Assembly I returnd to Cambridge, & from that time never enquired after nor regarded the matter further till you sent me Mr Linus's third letter. This is the history of Mr Linus buisines so far as I know't: which I have set down that his friends may see he has not been dealt with obliquely as they seem to apprehend. All I think that they can object to you is that you were at a stand becaus you could not ingage me in the controversy, & to me that I had no mind to be ingag'd: a liberty every body has a right to & may gladly make use of, sometimes at least, & especialy if he want leisure or meet with prejudice or groundles insinuations. But I hope to find none of this in Mr Gascoin. The hansome genius of his present Letter makes me hope it for the future. In the mean time I desire with him that you would publish Mr Linus's letters as soon as you can conveniently to prevent further misapprehensions. Sir I am Your obliged & humble Servant Is. Newton. Pray Sir let not my papers go out of your hands till you hear from me about registring them. In printing my former letter to Mr Linus you may leave out what I mention of Mr Hill & Mr Hook, or at least put letters for their names: for I beleive they had rather not be mentiond. If you have opportunity pray present my service to Mr Hook, for I suppose there is nothing but misapprehension in what has lately happend. Newtons Letter Rec. jan. 12. 7576.

In like maner if you would know the length of any other arch; as BGC, bisect its Chord in K, Draw AKG, and the Chords BG & GC: and make 4⁢BG+4⁢GC−BC3 the length of the arch BGC. Thus you may find BC and CD severally and the sum̄mme of them will give the Quadrant BCD, exacter then before.

Sir I received both your's & thank you for your care in disposing those things between me & Mr Linus. I suppose his friends cannot blame you at all for printing his first Letter, it being written I beleive for that end, & they never complaining of the printing of that but of the not printing that which followed, which I take my self to have been per accidens the occasion of by refusing to answer him. And though I think I may truly say I was very little concernd about it, yet I must look upon it as the result of your kindnes to me that you was unwilling to print it without an answer. As to the printing Paper of Observations which you move in the name of the Society to have printed, I cannot but return them my hearty thanks for the kind acceptance they meet with there; & know not how to deny any thing which they desire should be done. Only I think it will be best to suspend the printing of them for a while because I have some thoughts of writing such another set of Observations for determining the manner of the production of colours by the Prism, which, if done at all, ought to precede that now in your hands, & will do best to be joyned with it. But this I cannot do at presently by reason of some incumbrances lately put upon me by some friends, & some other buisines of my own which at present almost take up my time & thoughts. The additions that I intended, I think I must after putting you to so long expectations disappoint you in: for it puzzels me how to connect them with what I sent you; & if I had those papers yet I doubt the things I intended will not come in so freely as I thought they might have done. I could send them described without dependance on those papers, but I fear I have already troubled the Society & your self too much with my scribbling, & so suppose it may do better to defer them till another season. I have therefore at present only sent you two or three alterations though not of so great moment that I need have stayed you for them: & they are these. Where I say that nat the frame of nature may be nothing but Æther condensed by a fermental principle, instead of those words write that it may be nothing but various contextures of some certain æthereal spirits or vapours condensed as it were by precipitation, much after the manner that vapors are condensed into water or exhalations into grosser substances, though not so easily condensible; & after condensation fced wrought into various forms, at first by the immediate hand of God the Creator, & ever since by the power of nature, who by virtue of the command Increas & multiply became became a complete imitator of the copies set her by the Protoplast. Thus perhaps may all things be originated from æther, &c. A little after where I say the æthereal spirit may be condensed in fermenting or burning bodies or otherwise inspissated in the pores of the earth to a tender matter which may be as it were the succus nutritious of the earth or primary substance out of which things generable grow: instead of this you may write that that spirit may be condensed in fermenting or burning bodies or otherwise coagulated in the pores of the earth & water into some kind of humid adctive matter for the continual uses of nature, adhering to the sides of those pores after the manner that vapors condense on the sides of a vessel. In the same paragraph there is, I think, a parenthesis in which I mention volatile Saltpeter, pray strike out that Parenthesis least it should give offence to somebody. Also where I relate the expetriment of little papers made to move variously with a glas rubbed, I would have all that struck out which follows about trying the experiment with leaf gold.

Cambridge Sir I thank you for giving me notice of the objection which some have made. If I understand it right they meane that colour may proceed from the different velocities which æthereall pulses or rays of light may have as they come immediately from the Sun. But Iif this be their meaning, they propound not an objection but an Hypothesis to explain my Theory. For the better understanding of this I shall desire you to consider that I put not the different refrangibility of rays to be the primary internal or for formal or essential cause of colours, but only the means whereby rays of different colours are separated. Neither do I say what is that cause, either of colour or of different refrangibility, but leave these to be explained by Hypotheses, & only say that rays which differ in colour, differ also in refrangibility, & that different refrangibility conduces to the production of colour no other way then by causing a different refraction & thereby a separatingon of those rays which had different colours before, but could not appear in their own colours till they were separated. Suppose red & blew pouders (as Minium & Bise) were equally mixed, the compound would be neither a good red nor a good blew but a midling dirty colour. Suppose further this mixture was put into water, & after the water had been well stirred, the pouders left to subside; if the red was much more ponderous then the blew, it would subside fastest & leave most of the blew to subside after it; & by consequence the heape would appear red at bottom & blew at top, & of intermediate colours between. Here then are various colours produced out of a dirty colour by means of different gravity, & yet that different gravity was not the formal internal cause of those colours, but only the cause of the separation of the particles of several colours. And so it is in the production of colours by the Prism: the different refrangibility of rays is no otherwise the cause of colour in this case then the different gravity of the pouders was in the other; it only causes a divers refraction of the rays originally qualified to exhibit divers colours, & by that divers refraction they are separated & when separated they must needs exhibit each their own cololurs which they could not do in the mixture while mixed. Had I supposed different refrangibility the internal or formal cause of colours, it would have been strangely precarious, & scarcely intelligible; but to make it only the cause of separation of rays indowed with diverentdifferent colours is nothing but experiment, & all that I have asserted in my writings. In like manner where I make different reflexibility the cause of different colours (as in the case of thin transparent plates) I say not that it is their internal cause but only the means of their separation. For I apprehend that all the Phænomena of colours in the world result from nothing but separations or mixtures of difform rays & that different refrangibility & reflexibility are only the means by which those separations or mixtures are made. This being apprehended, I presume you will easily see that you have not sent me an objection but only an Hypothesis to explain my Theory by. For to this suppose different velocities of the rays the principle of colour is only to assign a cause of the the different colours which rays are originally disposed to exhibit & do exhibit when separated by different refractions. And though this should be the true essential cause of those different colours yet it hinders not but that the different refrangibility ray of the rays may be the their accidental cause by causing making a separation of pulses of different swiftness. Yea so far is this Hypothesis from contradicting me that if it be supposed it infers all my Theory. For if it be true, then is the sun's light an aggregate of heterogeneal rays such are originally disposed to exhibit various colours: then is the whitenes of that Sun light a mixture of those colours, being the result of the mixture of those unequal colorific motions: then is there nothing requisite for the production of colours but a separation of these rays so that the swiftest may go to one place by themselves & the slowest to another by themselves, or one sort be stifled & another remain: then must all the phænomena of colours proceed from the separations of these rays of unequal swiftness because while they continue blended together, as in the sun's original light, they can exhibit no other colour but white: & lastly; then must various refrangibility & reflexibility be the instrumental causes of the Phænomena of colour, those two being the proper means whereby difform rays are separated. Were I to apply this Hypothesis to my notions I would say therefore that the slowest pulses being weakest are more easily turned out of the way by any refracting superficies then the swiftest, & so cæteris paribus are more refracted: and that the Prism by refracting them more separates them from the swiftest, & then they being freed from the alloy of one another strike the sence distinctly each with their own motions apart & so beget different sensations of colour both f different both from one another & from that which they begat while mixed together; suppose the swiftest the strongest colour, red; and the slowest the weakest, blew. To all this I might add concerning the different swiftness of rays that I my self have formerly applyed it to my notions in mentioning other Hypotheses, as you may see in my answer to Mr Hook sect. 4, & I think also in the Hypothesis I lately sent you. I say I applyed it in other Hypotheses; for in this of Mr Hook I think it is much more natural to suppose the pulses equally swift & to differ only in bigness, because it is so in the air, & the laws of undulation are without doubt the same in æther that they are in air. Having thus answered, as I conceive, your objection in particular; I shall now for a conclusion remind you of what I have formerly said in general to the same purpose: so that I may at once cut off all objections that may be raised for the future either from this or any other Hypothesis whatever. If you consider what I said both in my second letter to P. Pardies & in my answer to Mr Hook sect 4. concerning the application of all Hypotheses to my Theory you may thence gather this general rule. That in any Hypothesis whence the rays may be supposed to have any originall diversitaies, whether as to size or figure or motion or force or quality or any thing els imaginable which may suffice to difference those rays in colour & refrangibility, there is no need to seek for other causes if these effects then (colours & different refrangibility) then those original diversities. This rule being laid down, I argue thus. In any ical 52.cal Hypothesis whatever that can be propounded, light as it comes from the Sun must be supposed either homogeneal or heterogeneal. If the last, then is that Hypothesis comprehended in this general rule & so cannot be against me: if the first then must refractions have a power to modify light so as to change that it's colorifick qualification & refrangibility; which is against experience. Since the writing of this I receivd your other letter. I thank you for your account of Mr Berchhenshaw's scale of Musick though I have not so much skill in that science as to understand it well. If you should register the papers in your hand before you return them, I would desire you to leave out the last paragraph of the Hypothesis where I mention Mr Hook & Grimaldo together: but since you are to receive those papers again (that of the observations at least; for the Hypothesis I am more inclind to suppress,) I suppose it will not be necessary that you should put your self to the trouble of registring them.

Sir I received your letter conteining that of Mr Lucas & this afternoon another from your self by Mr White with the last Transactions, for which I thank you. [N. 131. p. 785. Exp. 13.The speculation of the figures of confining liquors. I am apt to think with Mr Boyll may by degrees administer very considerable thoughts to such as are contriving mechanical systems systems of Phy: but the last of the Phænomena, where an oyle lighter than spirit of wine poured on the Alcaly deliquated made a very specular superficies in their confine, being more in the way of theseings I have been sometimes considering; I shal rather present you with anwhat thoughts occur to me about that, presuming you will excuse my randome guesses] because it is by your desire that I write them. [I imagin then that as spirit of wine, though lighter than water, is yet a more strongly refracting liquor; so the refractive density of this lighter oyle may be still greater, so as much to exceed that of the Alcalizate liquor. And if so then the propounded Phonomenon may keep analogy with that of other reflecting superficies. For the reflexive power of any superficies (so far as my observation reaches) is proportional to the difference of the refractive densities of the bordering mediums. And (which I take to be the present case,) the same superficies reflexcts much more strongly towards on that side towards the denser (I mean the more strongly refractive) medium then towards the rarer on the opposite side. Butesidtoes when that side towards the denser Medium is viewed, obliquely enough, it always reflects all the light to the eye as much as quicksilver does: & the greater the difference of the refractive density of the mediums is, the less obliquity is requisite to produce this phænomenon. This total reflexion holds toin all positions of the eye. not less oblique then to a certain limit: & if the eye be held less oblique then at that limit, the reflexion grows very sensibly fainter on a seuddemsudden, & is faintest of all when the superficies is viewed perpendicularly. The mentioned limit, a skilful Optician, by knowing the refractive power of the liquors would esasily assigne. If the experiment were therefore to be tryed again it might not be amis to observe whither if the common superficies of the liquors be viewed by degrees less & less obliquely, the reflexion does not begin to grow faint at a certain position of the eye & from thence forward grow insensibly fainter & fainter till the eye be perpendicularly over the superficies. 2 Whether the lighter oyle be not more strongly refractive than the oyle of Tartar. 3 Whether the obliquity at which the reflecxtion grows begins to grow faint, be not such as a Mathematician would compute it by having the different densities refractive powers of the two liquors given, that is, the rathios of their sines of incidence & refraction. 4: Whether if the light oyle be powred on the some more strongly refracting liquor then the alcalizate one (such as butter of Antimony per deliquium (as I may call the solution of it made by exposing it to the air) may be) the common superficies be not less stronlgly reflexive then when the Alcalizate liquor or common water of is used.] The Phosophorus seems to me a very extraordinary thing, but I cannot yet deduce any thing from it. I am going out of town for a few days, & when I return I shall think of an sanswer to Mr Lucas, in the mean time I rest Your humble servant Is. Newton.

13,Isaac Newton,Science,Letter to Oldenburg answering Linus's second letter on Newton's new doctrine of light and colour,EL/N1/51,29 February 1676,England,['English'],"5151 Cambridge. Feb. 29. 16756. A particular Answer of Mr Isaac Newton to Mr Linus his Letter, printed in Numb. 121. p. , about the an Experiment relating to the New doctrine of Light and Colors: This Answer sent from Cambridge in a Letter to the Publisher Febr. 29. 16756. Sir By reading Mr Linus's letter when you shewed it to me at London, I retained only a general remembrance that Mr Linus denyed what I affirmed & so could lately say nothing in particular to it; but having the opportunity to read it again in Numb. 121. inof the Transactions, I perceive he would persuade you, that the information you gave him about the experiment is as inconsistent with my printed Letters, as with Experience; & therefore, least any sil who have not read those letters should take my silence herein in this point for an acknowledgment, I thought it not amis, to send you something in answer to this th to this also. He tells you that, whereas you assure him, First, that the Experiment was made in clear days; secondly, that the Prism was placed close to the hole so that the light had no room to diverge; & thirdly, that the Image was not parallel but Transvers to the axis of the Prism:; If these assertions be compared with my relation of the experiment in the Phil. Transactions N. 80 p. 3076. it will evidently appear, they cannot be addmitted as being directly contrary to what is there delivered. His reasons are these; First, that I said, the ends of the long image seemed semicircular, which, saies he, never happens in any of the three cases above said. But I say it happens in them all, & this is not to sedt me at odds with my self, but with the experiment; for it is there described to happen in them all; & I still say, it doth happen in them. Let others try the experiment, and judge. Further he saies, that the Prism is placed at a distance from the hole in the Scheme of the Experiment in N. 84. p 4091. But, what if it were so there? For, that is the Scheme of a demonstration, not of the experiment, and would have served for the demonstration, had the distance been put twenty times greater than it is. In the Schemes of the Experiment N. 80. p. 3086, and N. 82. p. 5016 it is represented close, and close enough in the Scheme, N. 83. p. 4061: But Mr. Linus though fit to wink at these, and pitch upon the Schemeof a Demonstration, and such a Scheme too as hath no hole at all represented in it. For the Scheme ✝ ✝ See Fig. 1.Numb. 84. p. 491 is this; in which the rays are not so far distant from one another at GL, but that the hole, had I exprest it, might have been put there, and yet have comprehended them. But if we should put the hole at x, their decussation; yet will it not be any thing to his purpose; the distance xG or xL being but about half the breadth of a side of the Prism (12 AC) which I conceive is not the twentieth part of the distance requisite in his conjecture. 3. He says, that more might be said out of my relation to shew, that the Image was not transvers, for if it had been transvers, I could not have been surprized (as I said I was) to see the length thereof so much exceed the breadth, it being a thing so obvious & easie to be explicated by the ordinary rules of Refraction. But on the contrary, it may rather be said, that if the Image had been parallel, I could not have been surprized to see the the length thereof so much exceed the breadth, it being a thing so extreamly obvious as not to need any explication. For, what Naturall, (give me livor to argue,) that has but eyes in his head, knows not the sun shine from a bright cloud? And For who, that had but common sence, and saw the whole Prism or a good part of it illuminated, so tl by that or by the Sun's immediate light would not expect the light should have the same long figure upon the wall that it had when it came out of the Prism? Mr Linus therefore, while he would strengthen his argument by representing me well skilled in Opticks, does but overthrow it. But whereas he saides, I could not have been surprized at the length, had the Image been parallell, it being a thing so obvious & easy to be explicated by the ordinary rules of refraction: Let any man take the experiment intire, as I have there delivered it, that is, with this condition, that the refractions on both sides the Prism were equal, & try if he can reconcile it with the ordinary rules of refraction. On the contrary, he may find the impossibility of such a reconciliation demonstrated in my answer to P. Pardies N. 84, p. 4091. In the last place he objects, that my saying, in N. 80 p. 3077, that the incident Refractions were in the Experiment equal to the emergent, proves again that the long Image was parallel. And yet that very saying is a sufficient argument that I meant the contrary; because it becomes wholly impertinent, if applied to a parallel Image; but in the other case is a very necessary circumstance. What is added therefore of P. Pardies might have been spared, especially since that Learned person understood my discourse to be meant of a transvers Image, & acquiesced in my Answers. This in Answer to Mr. Linus's Letter: And now to take away the like suspicions from his Friends, if my declaration of my meaning satisfie not, I shall note some further passages in my Letters, whereby they may see, how I was to be understood from the beginning, as to the aforesaid three circumstances. For the Day; I express every where that the Experiment was tried in the Sun's light, and in N. 80. p. 3077, that the breadth of the Image by measure answered to the Sun's diameter: But because it is pretended, I was imposed upon, I would ask, what the Experiment as it is advanced to that which I called the Experimentum Crucis, can have to do with a cloudy day? For, if the Experimentum Crucis (which is that which I depend on) can have nothing to do with a cloudy day, then it is to no purpose to talk of a cloudy day in the first Experiment, which does but lead on to that. But if this satisfie not, let the Transactions N. 83. p. 4060, be consulted: For. there I tell you, how by applying a Lens to the Prism, the streight edges of the oblong Image became distincter than they would have been without the Lens: a circumstance which cannot happen in Mr. Linus's case of a bright cloud. For the Position of the Prism; I tell you N. 80. p. 3076, that it was placed at the Sun's entrance into the Chamber, and in p. 3085. I bad to make a hole in the shut, and there place the Prism, and in the next page I say again, that the Prism ABC is to be set close by the hole F of the window EG; and accordingly represent it close in the Figure. Also in pag. 3077 I tell you, that the distance of the Image from the hole or prism was 22 foot; which is as much as to say, that the Prism (suppose that side of it next the hole) was as far from the Image as the hole it self was, and consequently that the Prism and Hole were contiguous. Also in p. 3078, where instead of the Window shut I made use of a hole in a loose board, I tell you expressly, that I placed the board close behind the Prism. All these passages are in my very first Letter about Colours; and who therefore would imagine, that any one that had read that Letter should so much as suspect, that I placed the Prism, I say not at so great a distance as Mr. Linus supposes, but at any distance worth considering? Lastly, for the Position of the Image, it is represented transvers to the axis of the Prism in the figures N. 80. p. 3086. N. 83. p. 4061, and N. 85. p. 5016. And in N. 88. p. 5093, where I made use of two cross Prisms, I tell you expresly, that the Image was cross to both of them at an angle of 45 degrees. The calculations also N. 80. p. 3077. are not to be understood without supposing the Image cross. Nor are my notions about different Refrangibility otherwise intelligible: For in Mr. Linus's supposition, the rays that go to the two ends of the Image, are equally refracted. So the colours, the red, according to my description, falls at one end of the Image, and the blew at the other; which cannot happen but in a tranvers Image. The same position is also demonstrable from what I said in N. 80. p. 3076, about turning the long Image into a round one, by the contrary refraction of a second Prism, further explained in Num. 83. p. 4061. For this is not to be done in Mr. Linus surmise of a parallel Image, and therefore had Mr. Linus considered it, he could never have run into that surmise. This I suppose is enough to manifest the three particulars; any one of which being evidenced, is sufficient to tak away the scruple. And therefore Mr. Linus Friends need not fear but that the further directions I sent them lately for trying the Experiment are the same with those I have follow'd from the beginning; nor trouble themselves about any thing but to try the Experiment right. But yet, because Mr. Gascoin has been pleased to insinuate his suspicion that I do differ from himself in those directions, I shall not scruple here to reduce them to particulars, and shew where each particular is to be found. 1. Then, he is to get a Prism with an angle about 60 or 65 degrees, N. 80. p. 3077, and p. 3086. If the angle be about 63 degrees, as that was which I made use of N. 80. p. 3077, he will find all things succeed exactly as I described them there. But if it be bigger or less, as 30, 40, 50, or 70 degrees, the Refraction will be accordingly bigger or less, and consequently the Image longer or shorter. If his Prism be pretty nearly equilateral (such as I suppose are usually sold in other places as well as in England) he may make use of the biggest angle. But he must be sure to place the Prism so, that the Refraction be made by the two planes which comprehend this angle. I could almost suspect, by considering some circumstances in Mr. Linus's Letter, that his error was in this point, he expecting the Image should become as long by a little refraction as by a great one; which yet being too gross an error to be expected of any Optician, I say nothing of it, but only hint this to Mr. Gascoin, that he may examine all things. 2. Having such a Prism, he must place it so, that its Axis be perpendicular to the rays N. 84, p. 4091, lin. 18, 19. A little error in this point makes no sensible variation of the effect. 3. The Prism must be so placed, that the Refractions on both sides be equal N. 80, p. 3077: which how it was to be readily done by turning it about its Axis, and staying it when you see the Image rest between too contrary motions, as I explained in my late Descriptions, so I hinted before N. 80. p. 3077, lin. 34, 35, 36. If there should be a little error in this point also, it can do no hurt. 4. The Diameter of the hole I put 14 of an inch N. 80, p. 3077, and placed the Prism close to it, even so close as to be contiguous, N. 80, p. 3077, lin. 4, 5. But yet there needs no curiosity in these circumstances. The hole may be of any other bigness, and the Prism at a distance from the hole, ,, provided things be so ordered, that the light appear of a round form, if intercepted perpendicularly at its coming out of the Prism. Nor needs there any curiosity in the day. The clearer it is the better; but if it be a little bit cloudy, that cannot much prejudice the Experiment, so the Sun do but shine distinctly through the cloud. These things being thus ordered, if the refracted light fall perpendicularly on a wall or paper at 20 foot or more from the Prism, it will appear in an oblong form, cross to the axis of the Prism, red at one end, and violet at the other; the length five times the breadth (more or less according to the quantity of the refraction,) the sides, streight lines, parallel to one another, and the ends confused, but yet seeming semi-circular. I hope therefore, Mr. Linu'sLinus's Friends will not entertain themselves any further about incongruous surmises, but try the Experiment as Mr. Gascoin has promised. And then, since Mr. Gascoin tells you, That the Experiment being of it self extraordinary and surprizing, and besides ushering in new Principles into Opticks, quite contrary to the common and received, it will be hard to perswade it as a truth, till it be made so visible to all as it were a shame to deny it: if he esteem it so extraordinary, he may have the priviledg of making it so visible to all, that it will be a shame to deny it. For, I dare say, after his testimony no body else will scruple it. And I make no question but he will hit of it, it being so plain and easy, that I am very much at a loss to imagine what way Mr. Linus took to miss. Dat.

Sir I am now to return you thanks on a double account, the one for publishing my letter in your last Transactions, the other for motioning to get the Experiment in controversy, tryed before the Royal Society. I could be very desirous, not to say ambitious, to have such a thing done, did I not feare I should be troublesome, & therefore I shall esteem it a great favour if you please to get it done, being apt to think that Mr Linus's Friends will not otherwise acquiesce. Yesterday I reading the two last Philosophical Transactions, had the opportunity to consider Mr Boyles uncommon experiment about the incalescence of Gold & quicksilver. I beleive the fingers of many will itch to be at the knowledge of the preparation of such a quicksilver, & for that end some will not be wanting to move for the publishing of it, by urging the good it may do in the world; but in my simple judgment the noble Author since he has thought fit to reveale himself so far does prudently in being reserved in the rest. Not that I think any great excellence in such a quicksilver either for medical or Chymical operations: for it seems to me that the metalline particles with which that quicksilver is impregnated may be grosser than the particles of the quicksilver & be disposed to t mix more readily with the gold upon some other account then their subtilty, & then in so mixing, their grossnes may enable 54. them to give the parts of the gold the greater shock, & so put them into thata brisker motion then smaller particles could do: much after the manner that the saline particles wherewith corrosive liquors are impregnated heate many things which they are put to dissolve, whilst the finer parts of common water scarce heat any thing dissolved therein be the dissolution never so quick; & if they do heat any thing; (as quick lime) one may suspect that heat is produced by some saline particles lying hid in the body which the water sets on work upon the body which thyey could not act on whilst in a dry form. I would compare therefore this impregnated quicksilver to some corrosive liquor (as Aqua fortis) the mercurial part of the one to the saline watry or flegmatic part of the other, & the metallick particles with which the onequicksilver is impregnated to the saline particles with which the other is impregnated, both which I suppose may be of a middle nature between the liquor which they impregnate & the bodies they dissolve & so enter those bodies more freely & by their grossness shake the dissolved particles more strongly then a subtiler agent would do. If this analogy of these two kinds of liquors may be allowed, one may guess at the little use of the one by the indisposition of the other either to medicine or vegetation. But yet because the way by which such quicksilver may be so impregnated, has been thought fit to be concealed by others that have known it, & therefore may possibly be an inlet to something more noble, not to be communicated without immense dammage to the world if there should be any verity in the Hermetick writers, therefore I question not but that the great wisdom of the noble Authour will sway him to high silence till he shall be resolved of what consequence the thing may be either by his own experience, or the judgement of some other that throughly understands what they speakes about, that is of a true Hermetic Philosopher, if whose judgement (if there be any such) would be more to be regarded in this point then that of all the world beside to the contrary, there being other things beside the transmutation of metalls (if those great pretenders bragg not) which none but they understand. Sir because the Author seems desirous of the sense of others in this point, I have been so free as to shoot my bolt: but pray keep this letter private to your self Your Servant Is.

I perceive I went upon a wrong supposition in what I wrote concerning Mr Boyles Experiment The Papers in your hand I have no present need of: You may send them at your best leisure. Sometime this Sommer it's possible I may make use of them, if I can but get some time to write the other discourse about the colours of the Prism which I have long intended. Sir I am Your humble & obliged Servant Is. Newton. Cambridge May 11th 1676. For Henry Oldenburg Esqꝫ. at his house about the middle of the old Pal-mall in Westminster London. 2 Received d. 12. Maji. 1676. Answered by Dr Sidnam May 15. 76. and sent by him his Hypothesis and discourse explaining the properties of Light; as also his discourse about the various colors exhibited by transparent substances made very thin by being blown into bubbles or otherwise form'ded into plates, altho at a greater thicknes they appear very clar clear and colorlesse.

Dignissime Vir Quanquam D. Leibnitij, modestia in excerptis quæ ex Epistola ejus ad me nuper misisti nostratibus multum tribuat circa speculationem quandam infinitarūum serierum de quâ jam cœpit esse rumor: nullus dubito tamen quin ille, non tantum (quod asserit) methodum reducendi quantitates quascunqꝫue in ejusmodi series, sed et varia compendia, fortè nostris similia, si non et meliora, adinvenerit. Quoniam tamen ea scire pervelit quæ ab Anglis hâc in re inventa sunt, et ipse ante annos aliquot in hanc speculationem inciderim: ut votis ejus aliqua saltern ex parte satisfacerem iam, nonnulla eorum quæ mihi occurrerunt, ad et te transmisi. Fractiones in infinitas series reducuontur ꝑper divisionem et quantitates radicales ꝑper Extractionem radicum, perindè instituendo operationes istas in speciebus ac institui solent in decimalibus numeris. Hæc sunt fundamenta harum reductionum; sed extractiones radicum multum abbreviantur ꝑper hoc Theorema. P+P⁢Q‾mn=Pmn+mn⁢A⁢Q+m−n2⁢n⁢B⁢Q+m−2⁢n3⁢n⁢C⁢Q+m−3⁢n4⁢n⁢D⁢Q+&c. Ubi P+P⁢Q significat quantitatem cujus radix vel etiam dimentio quævis vel radix dimensionis investiganda est. P primum terminum quantitatis ejus, Q reliquos terminos divisos ꝑper primum, & mn numeralem indicem dimensionis ipsius P+P⁢Q sive dimentio illa integra sit, sive (ut ita loquar) fracta, sive affermativa, sive negativa. Nam sicut AnalycæAnalystæ pro a⁢a a⁢a⁢a &c scribere solent a2, a3, sic ego pro a, a3, c.a5 &c scribo a12, a32, a53, & pro 1a, 1a⁢a, 1a3 scribo a−1, a−2, a−3. Et sic pro a⁢ac:a3+b⁢b⁢x‾ scribo a⁢a×a3+b⁢b⁢x‾−13, & pro a⁢a⁢b.c:a3+b⁢b⁢x×a3+b⁢b⁢x‾ scribo a⁢a⁢b×a3+b⁢b⁢x‾−23: in quo ultimo casu si a3+b⁢b⁢x‾−23 conciapiatur esse P+P⁢Q‾mn in Regulâ; erit P=a3, Q=b⁢b⁢xa3, m=−2, & n=3.

For I imagin the difference between me & Mr Lucas lies either in the different angles of our Prisms; or in this that he perhaps measures the length of the Image by the streight sides, I by the middle line or axis; or in both together.

Leibnitij modestia, in excerptis quæ ex epistola ejus ad me nuper misisti, nostratibus multùm tribuat Mathematicis nostræ gentis circa speculationem quandam infinitarum serierum de qua jam cœpit esse rumor: nullus dubito tamen quin ille, non tantùm (quod asserit) methodum reducendi quantitates quascunqꝫue in ejusmodi series, sed et varia compendia, fortè nostris similia, si non et meliora, adinvenerit. Quoniam tamen ea scire pervelit quæ ab Anglis hac in re inventa sunt, et ipse ante annos aliquot in hanc speculationem inciderim: ut votis ejus aliqua saltern ex parte satisfacerem, nonnulla eorum quæ mihi occurrerunt, ad te transmisi. Fractiones in infinitas series reducuntur per divisionem et quantitates radicales per extractionem radicum, perinde instituendo operationes istas in speciebus ac institui solent in decimalibus numeris. Hæc sunt fundamenta harum reductionum; sed extractiones radicum, et divisiones, multum abbreviantur per hoc Theorema.

Nam sicut Analystæ pro a⁢a, a⁢a⁢a, &c scribere solent a2, a3, sic ego pro a, a3, c.a5 &c scribo a12, a32, a53, & pro 1a, 1a⁢a, 1a3 scribo a−1, a−2, a−3.

Ex his videre est quantum fines Analyseos per hujusmodi infinitas æquationes ampliantur: quippe quæ earum beneficio, ad omnia, pene dixerim, problemata (si numeralia Diophanti et similia excipias) sese extendit [ Non tamen omninò universalis evadit, nisi per ulteriores quasdem methodos eliciendi series infinitas. Sunt enim quædam Problemata in quibus non liceat ad series infinitas per divisionem vel extractionem radicum simplicium affectarumve pervenire: sed quomodo in istis casibus procedendum sit jam non vacat dicere, ut neqꝫue alia quædam tradere quæ circa reductionem infinitarum serierum in finitas, ubi rei natura tulerit, excogitavi. Nam hisce quanquam paucis scribendis fatigor, utpote parciùs scribo, quòd horum hæ speculationes diu mihi fastidio esse cœperunt, adeò ut ab ijsdem jam per quinqꝫue ferè annos abstinuerim. [ Unum tamen addam: quòd postquam Problema aliquod ad infinitam æquationem deducitur, possint inde variæ approximationes in usum Mechanicæ nullo ferè negotio formari, quæ per alias methodos quæsitæ, multo labore temporisqꝫue dispendio constare solent. [ Cujus rei exemplo esse possunt Tractatus Hugenij aliorumqꝫue de Quadratura circuli. Nam ut ex data arcûs chorda A, & dimidij arcûs chorda B arcum illum proxime assequaris, finge arcum illum esse z, et circuli radium r; juxtaqꝫue superiora erit A (nempe duplum sinus dimidij z) =z4 =z −z34×6⁢r⁢r+z54×4×120⁢r4−&c. Et B=12⁢z−z32×16×6⁢r⁢r+z52×16×16×120⁢r4−&c. Duc jam B in numerum fictitium n et a producto aufer A, et residui secundum terminum nempe−n⁢z32×16×6⁢r⁢r+z34×6⁢r⁢r, eo ut evanescat, pone =0, indeqꝫue emerget n=8, et erit 8⁢B−A=3⁢z∗−3⁢z564×120⁢r4+&c: hoc est 8⁢B−A3=z errore tantum existente z57680⁢r4−&c in excessu. Quod est Theorema Hugenianum. Insuper si in arcûs Bb sagittâ AD indefinitè productâ quæratur punctum G a quo actæ rectæ GB, Gb abscindant tangentem Ee quam proximè æqualem arcui isti: esto circuli centrum C, diameter AK=d, et erit DB sagitta AD=x et erit DB=d⁢x−x⁢x‾ =d12⁢x12−x3 22⁢d12−x528⁢d32−x7216⁢d52−&c Et AE =AB=d12⁢x12+x326⁢d12+3⁢x5240⁢d32+5x72112⁢d52+&c. Et AE−DB.AD∷AE.AG. Quare AG =32⁢d−15⁢x−12⁢x⁢x175⁢d−vel+&c. Finge ergo AG=32⁢d−15⁢x, et vicissim erit DG32⁢d−65⁢x.DB∷DA.AE−DB. Quare AE−DB=2⁢x323⁢d12+x525⁢d32+23⁢x72300⁢d52+&c. Adde AB et prodit AE=d12⁢x12+x326⁢d12+3⁢x5240⁢d32+17⁢x721200⁢d52+&c. Hoc aufer de valore ipsius AE supra habito et restabit error 16x72525⁢d52+vel−&c. Quare in AG cape AH quintam partem DH, et KG=HC; et actæ GBE, Gbe abscindent tangentem Ee quam proximè æqualem arcui Bab errore tantum existente 16x3525⁢d3⁢d⁢x+vel−&c; multò minore scilicet quam in Theoremate Hugenij. Quod si fiat 7⁢AK.3⁢AH∷DH.n, et capiatur KG=CH−n erit error adhuc multò minor. Atqꝫue ita si circuli segmentum aliquod BAb per Mechanicam designandum esset: primò reducerem aream istam in infinitam seriem; puta hanc BbA=43⁢d12⁢x32−2⁢x525⁢d12−x7214⁢d32−x9236⁢d52−&c; dein quærerem constructiones mechanicas quibus hanc seriem proximè assequeretur; cujusmodi sunt hæc. Age rectam AB, et erit segmentum BbA=23⁢AB+BD‾×45⁢AD proximè, existente scilicet errore tantum x370⁢d⁢d⁢d⁢x+&c, in defectu: vel proximiùs erit segmentum illud, (bisecto AD in F et acta recta BF,) =4⁢BF+AB15×4⁢AD, existente errore solummodo x3560⁢d⁢d⁢d⁢x+&c: qui semper minor est quàm 11500 totius segmenti, dummodo segmentum illud non ponatur semicirculus sit major semicircula etiamsi segmentum illud ad usqꝫue semicirculum augeatur. Sic et in Ellipsi BAb cujus vertex A, axis alteruter AK, et latus rectum AP, cape PG=12⁢AP+19⁢AK−21⁢AP10⁢AK×AP; in Hyperbola verò cape PG=12⁢AP+19⁢AK+21⁢AP10⁢AK×AP: et acta recta GBE abscindet tangentem AE quamproximè æqualem arcui Elliptico vel Hyperbolico AB, dummodo arcus ille non sit nimis magnus.

176,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Copy of a letter from Newton to Henry Oldenburg, dated 13 June 1676",MS Add. 3977.6,13 June 1676,England,['Latin'],"(6)1 Dignissime Domine Quanquam D. Leibnitij modestia in excerptis quæ ex Epistola ejus ad me nuper misisti, nostratibus multùm tribuat mathematicis nostræ gentis circa speculationem quandam infinitarum Serierum de qua jam cœpit esse rumor: nullus dubito tamen quin ille, non tantùm (quod asserit) methodum reducendi quantitates quascunqꝫue in ejusmodi series, sed et varia compendia, fortè nostris similia, si non et meliora, adinvenerit. Quoniam tamēen ea scire pervelit quæ ab Anglis hâc in re inventa sunt, et ipse ante annos aliquot in hanc speculationem inciderim: ut votis ejus aliqua saltern ex parte satisfacerem nonnulla eorum quæ mihi occurrerunt, ad te transmisi. Fractiones in infinitas Series reducuntur per divisionem et quantitates radicales per extractionem radicum, perindè instituendo operationes istas in speciebus ac institui solent in decimalibus numeris. Hæc sunt fundamenta harūum reductionum; sed extractiones radicum multùm abbreviantur per hoc Theorema. P+P⁢Q‾mn=Pmn+mn⁢A⁢Q+m−n2⁢n⁢B⁢Q+m−2⁢n3⁢n⁢C⁢Q+m−3⁢n4⁢n⁢D⁢Q+&c. Ubi P+P⁢Q significat quantitatem cujus radix, vel etiam dimensio, quævis vel radix dimensionis investiganda est, P primum terminum quantitatis ejus, Q reliquos terminos divisos per primum, & mn numeralem indicem dimensionis ipsius P+P⁢Q sive dimensio illa integra sit, sive (ut ita loquar) fracta, sive affermativa sive negativa. Nam sicut Analystæ pro a⁢a, a⁢a⁢a &c scribere solent a2, a3, sic ego pro a, a3, c.a5 &c scribo a12, a32, a53, & pro 1a, 1a⁢a, 1a3 scribo a−1, a−2, a−3. et sic pro a⁢ac:a3+b⁢b⁢x‾ scribo a⁢a×a3+b⁢b⁢x‾−13, & pro a⁢a⁢b.c:a3+b⁢b⁢x×a3+b⁢b⁢x‾ scribo a⁢a⁢b×a3+b⁢b⁢x‾−23 in quo ultimo casu si a3+b⁢b⁢x‾−23 conciapiatur esse P+P⁢Q‾mn in Regula; erit P=a3, Q=b⁢b⁢xa3, m=−2, & n=3. Deniqꝫue pro terminis inter operandum inventis in quoto, usurpo A, B, C, D &c nempe A pro primo termino Pmn, B pro secundo mn⁢A⁢Q, & sic deinceps. Cæterùm usus Regulæ patebit exemplis. Exempl: 1. est |c⁢c+x⁢x|‾seuc⁢c+x⁢x‾12=c+x⁢x2⁢c−x48⁢c3+x616⁢c5−5⁢x8128⁢c7 +7⁢x10256⁢a9+&c.. Nam in hoc casu est P=c⁢c, Q=x⁢xc⁢c, m=1, n=2, A=Pmn=c⁢c‾12=c. B=mn⁢A⁢Q=x⁢x2⁢c. C=m−n2⁢n⁢B⁢Q=−x48⁢c3, & sic deinceps. Exempl: 2. est ⑤c5+c4⁢x−x5‾i.e.c5+c4⁢x−x5‾15=c+c4⁢x−x55⁢c4−2⁢c8⁢x⁢x+4⁢c4⁢x6−2⁢x1025⁢c9+&c ut patebit substituendo in allatam Regulam, 1 pro m, 5 pro n, c5 pro P, & c4⁢x−x5c5 pro Q. Potest etiam −x5 substitui pro P, & c4⁢x+c5−x5 pro Q, et tunc evadet ⑤c5+c4⁢x−x5‾=−x+c4⁢x+c55⁢x4+2⁢c8⁢x⁢x+4⁢c9⁢x+c1025⁢x9 +&c. Prior modus eligendus est si x valde parvum sit, posterior si valde magnum. Exempl 3. Est N③y3−a⁢a⁢y‾hoc estN×y3−a⁢a⁢y‾−13=N×1y+a⁢a3⁢y3+2⁢a49⁢y5+7⁢a681⁢y7‾+ Nam P=y3. Q=−a⁢ay⁢y. m=−1. n=3. A=Pmn=y3×−13=y−1. hoc est 1y. B=mn⁢A⁢Q=−13×1y×−a⁢ay⁢y=a⁢a3⁢y3. &c Exempl. 4. Radix cubica ex quadrato-quadrato ipsius d+e (hoc est d+e‾43 est d43+4⁢e⁢d133+2⁢e⁢e9⁢d23−4⁢e381⁢d53+&c. Nam P=d. Q=ed. m=4. n=3. A=Pmn=d43 &c. Eodem modo simplices etiam potestates eliciuntur. Ut si quadrato-cubus ipsius d+ehoc estd+e‾5, seud+e‾51 desideretur: erit juxta Regulam P=d. Q=ed. m=5 & n=1; adeoqꝫue A=Pmn=d5, B=mn⁢A⁢Q=5⁢d4⁢e, & sic C=10⁢d3⁢e⁢e, D=10⁢d⁢d⁢e3, E=5⁢d⁢e4, F=e5, & G=m−5⁢n6⁢n⁢F⁢Q=0. Hoc est d+e‾5=d5+5⁢d4⁢e+10⁢d3⁢e⁢e+10⁢d⁢d⁢e3+5⁢d⁢e4+e5. Quinetiam Divisio, sive simplex sit, sive repetita, ꝑper eandem Regulam perficitur. Ut si 1d+e, hoc estd+e‾−1sived+e‾−11 in seriem simplicium terminorum resolvendum sit: erit juxta Regulam P=d. Q=ed. m=−1. n=1. & A=Pmn=D−11=d−1 seu 1d. B=mn⁢A⁢Q=−1×1d×ed =−ed⁢d, & sic C=e⁢ed3, D=−e3d4 &c Hoc est 1d+e=1d−ed⁢d+e⁢ed3−e3 d4+&c. Sic et d+e‾−3 (hoc est unitas ter divisa ꝑper d+e vel semel per cubum ejus,) evadit 1d3−3⁢ed4+6⁢e⁢ed5−10⁢e3d6+&c. Et N×d+e‾−13 hoc est N divisum ꝑper radicem cubicam ipsius d+e evadit N×1d13−e3⁢d43+2⁢e⁢e9⁢d73−14⁢e381⁢d108+&c Et N×d+e‾−35 (hoc est N divisum per radicem quadrato-cubicam ex cubo ipsius d+e, sive N⑤d3+3⁢d⁢d⁢e+3⁢d⁢e⁢e+e3‾ evadit N×1d35−3⁢e5⁢d95+12⁢e⁢e25⁢d135−52⁢e3125⁢d185&c. Per eandem Regulam Genesses Potestatum, Divisiones per potestates aut ꝑper quantitates radicales, & extractiones radicum altiorum in numeris etiam commodè instituuntur. Extractiones Radicum affectarum in speciebus imitantur earum extractiones in numeris, sed methodus Vietæ et Oughtredi nostri huic negotio minùs idonea est, Quapropter aliam excogitare adactus sum cujus specimen exhibent sequentia Diagrammata ubi dextra columna prodit substituendo in media columnâ Valores ipsorum y, p, q, r &c in sinistra columna expressos.

Sed hic præcipua difficultas est in inventione primi termini radicis: id quod methodo generali perficitur, sed hoc brevitatis gratia jam prætereo, ut et alia quædam quæ ad conccinnandam operationem spectant. Neqꝫue hic compendia tradere vacat, sed dicam tantum in genere, quod radix cujusvis æquationis semel extracta pro regula resolvendi consimiles æquationes asservari possit; & quod ex pluribus ejusmodi regulis, regulam generaliorem plerumqꝫue efformare liceat; quodqꝫue radices omnes, sive simplices sint sive affectæ, modis infinitis extrahi possint, de quorum simplicioribus itaqꝫue semper consulendum est. 4) Quomodo ex æquationibus, sic ad infinitas series reductis, areæ & longitudines curvarum, contenta et superficies solidorum, vel quorumlibet segmentorum figurarum quarumvis eorumqꝫue centra gravitatis determinantur, et quomodo etiam curvæ omnes Mechanicæ ad ejusmodi æquationes infinitarum serierum reduci possint, indeqꝫue Problemata circa illas resolvi perinde ac si geometricæ essent, nimis longum foret describere. Sufficiat specimina quædam talium Problematum recensuisse: inqꝫue iis brevitatis gratia literas A, B, C, D &c pro terminis seriei, sicut sub initio, nonnunquam usurpabo. 1.

15,Isaac Newton,Science,"Letter to Oldenburg on the lengths and angles of prism images, dated 18 August 1676",EL/N1/53,18 August 1676,England,"['English', 'Latin']","53Newton 1253 For Henry Oldenburg Esqꝫ.. An Mr Newtons Answer to the precedent Letter, sent to the Publisher. The Copy of this is sent to Liege to Mr Lucas Aug. 23. 1676. Sir The things opposed by Mr Line being upon tryalls found true & granted me; I begin with the new question about the proportion of the length of the Image to it's breadth. This I call a new one, for though Mr Line in his last letter spake against so great a length as I assigne, yet, as it seems to me, it was not to grant any transvers length shorter then that assigned by me (for in his first letter he absolutely denyed that there would be any such length;) but to lay the greater emphasis upon his discours whilst he in defence of common Optiques he was disputing in general against a transvers Image: & therefore in my answer I did not prescribe the just quantity of the refracting angle with which I would have the experiment repeated : which would have been a necessary circumstance had the dispute been about the just proportion of the length to the breadth. Yet I added * * In my 1st letter in Phil. Trans. N. 121. p. 500. this note, that the bigger the angle of the Prism is, the greater will be the length in proportion to the breadth: not imagining but that when he had found in any Prism the length of the Image transvers to the breadth axis, he would easily thence conclude that a Prism with a greater angle would make the Image longer, & consequently that by using an angle great enough he might bring it to equal or exceed the length assigned by me: as indeed he might, for by taking an angle of 70 or 75 degrees, or a little greater, he might have made the length not only 5 but 6 or 8 times the breadth & more. No wonder therefore that Mr Lucas found the Image shorter then I did, seing he tryed the experiment with a less angle. T The angle indeed which I used was but about 63degr., 12min, & his is set down 60degr: the difference of which from mine being but 3degr., 12min, is too little to reconcile us, but yet it will bring us considerably nearer together. And if his angle was not exactly measured, but the round number of 60degr. set down by guess or by a less accurate measure (as I suspect by the conjectural measure of the refraction of his prism by the ratio of the sines 2 to 3 set down instead of at the same time instead of an experimental one,) then might it be two or three degrees less then 60, if not still less: & all this, if it should be so, would take away away the greatest part of the difference between us. But however it be, I am well assured my own observation was exact enough. For I have repeated it divers times since the receipt of Mr Lucas's letter, & that without any considerable difference of my observations either from one another or from what I wrote before. And that it might appear experimentally how the increase of the angle increases the length of the Image, & also that no body who has a mind to try the experiment exactly might be troubled to procure a Prism which has an angle just of the bigness assigned by me; I have tryed the experiment with divers angles; & have have set down my trialls in the following table; where the first column expresses the six angles of two Prisms which I used, which were measured as exactly as I could by applying them to the angle of a Sector; & the second column expresses in inches the length of the image made by each of those angles; its breadth being two inches: its distance from the hole in the window shut Prism 18 feet & 4 inches, & the breadth of the hole in the window shut 14 of an inch. The angles ofdegrmin The lengthsofyeImage ye1stPrism{56.1000 60.2400 63.2600 073409121013 ye2dPrism{54.0000 62.1200 63.4800 071310181034 Yyyy 6. You may perceive that the lengths of the images in respect of the angles that made them, are something greater in the second Prism then in the first: but that was because the glass of which the second Prism was made, had the greater refractive power. The days in which I made these trialls were pretty clear but not so clear as I desired, & therefore afterward meeting with a day as clear as I desired, I repeated the experiment with the second Prism, & found the lengths of the image made by its severall angles to be those set down in this table about 14 of an inch greater then before, the measures being those set down in this table. The angles ofdegrmin The lengthsofyeImage ye2dPrism{54.0000 62.1200 63.4800 0723.1012.11.00 The reason of this difference I apprehend was partly that in the clearest days, the light of the white skies which dilutes & renders invisible the faintest colours at the ends of the Image is a little diminished in a clear day & so gives leave to the lcolours to appear to a greater length; the Sun's light at the same time becoming brisker & so strengthening the colours & making the faint ones at the two ends more53– more conspicuous. For I have observed that in days something cloudy, whilst the Prism has stood unmoved at the window, the image would grow a little longer or a little shorter accordingly as the Sun was more or less obscured by thin clouds which passed over it; the image being shortest when the cloud was brightest & the suns light faintest. Whence it is easy to apprehend that if the light of the clouds could be quite taken away, so that the Sun might appear surrounded with darkness, or if the suns light was much more stronger then it is the colours would still appear to a greater length. In all these observations the breadth of the Image was just two inches. But observing that the sides of the two Prisms I used were not exactly plain but a little convex, (the convexity being about so much as that of a double convex glass of an sixteen or eighteen foot Telescope), I took a third Prism whose sides were as much concave as those of the other were convex; & this made the breadth of the Image to be two inches & a third part of an inch: the angles of that this Prism & the lengths of thise Image made by each of those angles being those exprest in this Table The anglesof the Prismdegr. The lengths ofofyeImage in inches.degr. 5800 5912 6212 0812. 09.121013. In this case you see the concave figure of the sides of the Prism by making the rays diverge a little, causes the breadth of the Image to be greater in proportion to its length then it would be otherwise. And this I thought fit to give you notice of, that Mr Lucas may examin whether his Prism have not this fault. If a Prism may be had with sides exactly plain, it may do well to try the experiment with that: but it's better if the sides be about so much convex as those of mine are, because the Image will thereby become much better defined. For this convexity of the sides does the same effect as if you should use a Prism with sides exactly plain, & between it & the hole in the window shut, place an object-glass of an 18 foot Telescope to make the round image of the sun appear distinctly defined on the wall when the Prism is taken away, & consequently the long image made by the Prism to be much more distinctly defined (especially at it's streight sides) then it would be otherwise. One thing more I shall add: That thee utmost length of thee Image from the faintest red at one end to the faintest blew at the other, must be measured. For in my first letter about colours where I set down the length to be five times the breadth, I called that length the utmost length of the image; & I measured the utmost length, because I account all that length to be caused by the immediate light of the sun, seing the colours (as I noted above) become visible to the greatest length in the clearest days, that is, when the light of the Sun transcends most the light of the clouds. Sometimes there will happen to shoot out from both ends of the Image a glaring light a good way beyond these colours, but this is not to be regarded, as not apperteining to the Image. If the measures be taken right the whole length will exceed the length of the streight sides by about the breadth of the Image. By these things set down thus circumstantially, I presume Mr Lucas will be enabled to accord his trials of the Experiment with mine; so nearly at least that there shall not remain any very considerable difference between us. For if some little difference should still remain, that need not trouble us any further seeing there may be many various circumstances which may conduce to it; such as are not only the different figures of prisms, but also the different refractive power of glasses, the different diameters of the Sun at divers times of the year, & the little errors that may happen in measuring lines & angles, or in placing the Prism at the d window: though for my part I took care to do these things as exactly as I could. However Mr Lucas may make sure to find the Image as long asor longer then I have set down, if he take a Prism whose sides are not hollow grownd, but plain, or (which is better) a very little convex, & whose refracting angle is as much greater then that I used as that he has hitherto tryed it with is less; that is, whose angle is about 66 or 67 degrees, or (if he will) a little greater. Concerning Mr Lucas's other experiments, I am much obliged to him that he would take these things so far into consideration, & be at so much pains for examining them; & I thank him so much the more because he is the first that has sent me an experimental examination of them. By this I may presume he really desires to know what truth there is in these matters. But yet it will conduce to his more speedy & full Zzzz 7 703pray ed2d turn this a Leafsatisfaction if he a little change the method which he has propounded, & instead of a multitude of things try only the Experimentum Crucis. For it is not number of Experiments, but weight to be regarded; & where one will do, what need many? Had I thought more requisite, I could have added more. For before I wrote my first letter to you about colours I had taken much pains in trying experiments about them & written a Tractate on that subject wherein I had set down at large & considered the principall of the experiments I had tryed; amongst the rest which there has happened to be the principal of those which Experiments which Mr Lucas has now sent me. And as for the Experiments set down in my first letter to you, they were only such as I thought convenient to select out of that Tractate. But53– But yet suppose those had been my whole store, yet Mr Lucas should not have grownded his discourse upon a supposition of my want of experiments till he had examined those few. For if any of those be demonstrative, they will need no assistants nor leave room for further disputing about what they demonstrate. The main thing he goes about to examin is the different refrangibility of light. And this I demonstrated by the eExperimentuum Crucis. Now if this demonstration be good, there needs no further examination of the thing; if not good the fault of it is to be shewn: for the only way to examin a demonstrated proposition is to examin the demonstration. Let that experiment therefore be examined in the first place, & that which it proves be acknowledged, & then if Mr Lucas want my assistance to unfold the difficulties which he fancies to be in the experiments he has propounded, he shall freely have it; for then I presume a few words may make them plain to him: whereas should I be drawn from a demonstrative experiment to begin with those, it might create us both the trouble of a long dispute, & by the multitude of words cloude rather then clear up the truth. For if it has already cost us so much trouble to agree upon the matter of fact in the first & plainest experiment, & yet we are not fully agreed: what an endless trouble might it create us, if we should give our selves up to dispute upon every argument that occurs, & what would become of truth in such a tedious dispute. 4 Zz 704The way therefore that I propound being the shortest & clearest (not to say the only proper way,) I question not but Mr Lucas will be glad that I have recommended it, seeing he professes that it is the knowledge of truth that he seeks after. And therefore at present I shall say nothing in answer to Mr his experimental discourse but this in general: that it has proceeded partly from some misunderstanding of what he writes against, & partly from want of due caution in trying experiments; & that amongst his experiments there is one, which when duely tryed, is, next to the Experimentum Crucis, the most conspicuous Experiment I know for proving the different refrangibility of light, which he brings it to disprove against. By the Post-script of Mr Lucas's letter, one not acquainted with what has passed, might think, that he quotes the Observation of the R. Society against me; whereas the relation of their Observation, which you sent to Leige, conteined nothing at all about the just proportion of the Length of the Image to it's Breadth according to the angle of the Prism, nor any thing more (so far as I can perceive by your last) than what was pertinent to the things then in dispute, viz, that they found them succeed as I had affirmed. And therefore since Mr Lucas has found the same success, I suppose suppose that when he expressesd that he much rejoyced to see the trialls of the R. Society agree so exactly with his, he meant only so far as his agreed with mine. And because I am again upon this first experiment, I shall desire that Mr Lucas will repeat it with all the exactness & caution that may be, regard being had to the information about it, set down in this letter; & then I desire to have the length & breadth of the Image with its distance from the hole in the window shut, Prism set down exactly in feet & inches & parts of an inch, that I may have an opportunity to consider what relation it's length & breadth have to the sun's diameter. For I know, that Mr Lucas's Observation cannot hold where the refracting angle of the Prism is full 60degr:, & the breadth of the Im day is clear & the full length of the colours is measured, & the breadth of the Image answers to the sun's diameter: & seeing I am well assured of the truth & exactness of my own observation, I shall be unwilling to be diverted by any other experiments from having a fair end made of this in the first place. Sir I am Your humble Servant Is. Newton. Cambridge Aug 18. 1676 Postscript. I had like to have forgotten to advise that the Experimentum Crucis, & such others as shall be made for knowing the nature of colours; be made with Prisms which refract so much as to make the length of the Image five times it's breadth, & rather more then less; for, otherwise Experiments will not succeed so plainly with others as they have done with me.",NATP00323,1676-08-18 00:00:00

Sir I received the Packet you sent & return you the manuscript papers with my thanks for them & for Mr Frenicle's book. In your paper about Mr Gregory I have presumed to race out two things as you will perceive; the first because though about 5 or 6 years agoe I wrote a discourse in which I explained the doctrine of infinite æquations, yet I have not hitherto read it but keep it by me: the last because in my generall method mentioned in your 4th section, I have occasion to make use of no other way of extracting the roots of affected æquations then that you are already acquainted with. If you should have occasion to see Dr Pell or (if he be not in London) to write to him at any time, pray present my service to him & let him know that (though I know not how far Mr Gregory has improved the Method of infinite series yet) so far as I know any thing of it I account it of no great advantage for resolving affected æquations in numbers. Some use it may have sometimes this way but I neither invented it nor recommend it much for this end, but for g extending Algebra to such sorts of Problems as have had are not the common ways of computing extend not to. And therefore his method for resolving æquations interfering so little with mine, I could wish (even though they interfered much more) that he would not stay to expect the publishing of mine, as I perceive by one of the papers you sendt me he does: For I would not be an instrument of hindring the publick so long from enjoying any a thing so valuable. I have nothing in the press, only Kinckhuysens Algebra I would have got printed here to satisfy the expectation of some friends in London, but our Press cannot do it. This I suppose is the book Dr Lloyd means. It is now in the hands of a Bookseller here to get it printed: but if it doe come out I shall ad nothing to it. As for my paper I sent about infinite series, I know not whether it will be proper to print it. I leave it to your discretion. In my apprehension it may do as well to suppress it, but if you think otherwise I desire you would give me notice before it go into the Press, because of altering an expression or two. Mr Baker's patience as well as his skill I admire. His method I see is to find first X the summ of the 4 quantities & then the quantities severally, which I think is the method you were suggesting to me at London. The other Problem I think I told you required no art but much calculation to resolve it, & therefore I have never thought of it since I saw you. There is nothing requisite to the solution but this: To find two equations expressing the nature of the two curve lines, supposing their bases coincident & their ordinates parallel; & then the toto the end putting the same letter suppose x for the bases in both æquations, & another letter suppose y for the ordinates, to exterminate one of those letters. & reduce the For the resulting equation will give yeou the several valors of the other letter, which valors limit all the intersection points of the two curves. I doubt I shal put you to too much trouble to transcribe Mr Leibnitz's whole letter if it be so long, & therefore I shall desire you to send me only a general account of it, with such passages as you think may concern me, if there be any thing that concerns me. Sir I am Your humble Servant Is. Newton.

174,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Copy of a Letter from Newton to Henry Oldenburg, dated 24 October 1676",MS Add. 3977.4,24 October 1676,England,"['Latin', 'with one Greek word']","1 Vir dignisime Quanta cum voluptate legi Epistolas rissimorūum Clarissimorūum virorūum D. Leibnitij & D. Tschurnhausij vix dixerim. Perelegans Sane est Leibnitij methodus perveniendi ad series convergentes, & satis ostendisset ingeniūum Authoris etsi nihil aliud scripsisset. Sed quæ alibi per Epistolam sparguntur suo nomine dignissima, efficiunt etiam ut ab eo speremus maxima. Diversitas modorūum quibus eodem tenditur, eò magis placuit, quod mihi tres methodi perveniendi ad ejusmodi series innotuere, et tamen illa Leibnitij ante lectas literas ejus penitus me latuit adeò ut novam nobis communicandam vix expectarem. Unam e meis priùs descripsi, jāam addo aliam. illāam scilicet quâ primùm incidi in has series: nam incidi in eas antequam scirem divisiones et extractiones radicūum quibus jam utor. et hujus explicatione pendendum est fundamentūum Theorematis sub initio Epistolæ prioris positi quod D. Leibnitius a me desiderat. Sub initio studiorūum meorūum Mathematicorūum ubi incideram in opera Celeberrimi Wallisij nostri, considerando series quarum intercalatione ipse exhibet aream circuli, et Hyperbolæ, utpote quod in serie curvarūum quarūum basis sive axis communis sit x, et ordinatim applicatæ, 1−x⁢x|‾02.1−x⁢x|‾12.1−x⁢x|‾22.1−x⁢x|‾32.1−x⁢x|‾42.1−x⁢x|‾52.&c. si areæ alternarūum quæ sunt x.x−13⁢x3.x−23⁢x3+15⁢x5.x−33⁢x3+35⁢x5−17⁢x7&c interpolari possent, haberemus areas intermediarūum quarūum prima 1−x⁢x|‾12 est circulus: ad has interpolandas notabam, quod in omnibus primus terminus esset x, quodqꝫue secundi termini 03⁢x3.13⁢x3. 23⁢x3.33⁢x3&c essent in Arithmeticâ progressione, & proinde quod duio primi termini serierūum intercalandarūum deberent esse x−12⁢x33.x−32⁢x33.x−52⁢x33&c. Ad reliquas intercalandas considerabam quod denominatores 1.3.5.7&c erant in arithmeticâ progressione, et proinde quod primi adeoqꝫue solæ numeratorūum coefficientes numerales restabant investigandæ. Hæ autem in alternis datis areis erant figuræ potestatūum numeri 11 nempe harum 11|‾0.11|‾1.11|‾2.11|‾3.11|‾4. hoc est primò 1. dein 1,1. tertiò 1.2.1. quarto 1.3.3.1. quinto 1.4.6.4.1. Quærebam itaqꝫue quomodo in his seriebus ex datis duabꝫus primis figuris reliquæ derivari possent, et inveni quod positâ secundâ figura m, reliquæ producerentur per continuam multiplicationēem terminorūum hujus seriei m−01×m−12×m−23×m−34×m−45&c. Exempli gratia sit m=4, et erit 4× 4×m−12 hoc est 6 tertius terminus, & 6×m−23 hoc est 4 quartus, et 4×m−34 hoc est 1 quintus, & 1×m−45 . hoc est 0 sextus, quo series in hoc casu terminatur. Hanc regulam itaqꝫue applicui ad series interserendas et cùm pro circulo secundus terminus esset 12⁢x33, posui m=12, et prodierunt termini 12×12−12 sive −18, −18× 12−23 sive +116, 116×12−34 sive −5128 & sic in infinitūum. Unde cognovi desideratāam aream segmenti circularis esse x−12⁢x33− 18⁢x55−116⁢x77−5128⁢x99&c. Et eadem ratione prodierunt etiam interserendæ areæ reliquarum curvarūum, ut et area Hyperbolæ et cæterarūum alternarūum in hac serie 1+x⁢x|‾02,1+x⁢x|‾12 1+x⁢x|‾22.1+x⁢x|‾32&c. Et eadem est ratio intercalandi alias series idqꝫue per intervalla duorūum pluriumve terminorūum simul deficientium. Hic fuit primus meus ingressus in has meditationes: qui memoriâ sane exciderat nisi oculos in adversaria quædam ante paucas septimanas retulissem. Ubi verò hæc didiceram mox considerabam terminos 1−x⁢x|‾02.1−x⁢x|‾22.1−x⁢x|‾42.1−x⁢x|‾62&c hoc est 1.1−x⁢x.1−2⁢x⁢x+x4.1−3⁢x⁢x. +3⁢x4−x6&c eodem modo interpolari posse ac areas ab ipsis generatas: et ad hoc nihil aliud requiri quam omissionem denominatorūum denominatorūum 1,3,5,7&c. in terminis exprimentibus areas; hoc est coefficientes terminorūum quantitatis intercalandæ 1−x⁢x|‾12x12, vel 1−x⁢x|‾32 vel generaliter 1−x⁢x|‾m, prodire per continuam multiplicationēem terminorūum hujus seriei m×m−12×m−23 ×m−34&c ×m−23×m−34 Adeo ut e.g. 1−x⁢x|‾12 valeret 1−12⁢x2−18⁢x4 −116⁢x6&c et 1−x⁢x|‾32 valeret 1−32⁢x⁢x+38⁢x4+116⁢x6&c et 1−x⁢x|‾13 valeret 1−13⁢x⁢x−19⁢x4−581⁢x6&c. Sic itaqꝫue innotuit mihi generalis reductio radicalium in infinitas series per regulam illam quam posui initio Epistolæ prioris antequam scirem extractionem radicūum. Sed hac cognita non potuit altera me diu latere: nam ut probarem has operationes multiplicavi 1−12⁢x2−18⁢x4−116⁢x6&c in se, et factūum est 1−x⁢x terminis reliquis in infinitūum evanescentibus per continuationem seriei.

Qui una cum superioribus per Logarithmum numeri 10 divisi evadunt veri Logarithmi in Tabulam inserendi. Sed hos postea propius obtinui. Pudet dicere ad quot figurarūum loca has computationes otiosus eo tempore perduxi. Nam tunc sanè nimis delectabar inventis hisce. Sed ubi prodijt ingeniosa illa N. Mercatoris Logarithmotechnia (quem suppono sua primum invenisse) cœpi ea minùs curare, suspicatus vel eum nosse extractionēem radicūum æquò ac divisionem fractionūum, vel alios saltem, divisione patefacta, inventuros reliqua priusquam ego ætatis essem maturæ ad scribendūum. Eo ipso tamen tempore quo liber iste prodijt communicatum est a D. Barrow tunc Matheseos per amicum Professore ad cum D. Collinsio , compendium quoddam methodi harum serierūum in quo significaveram areas, et longitudines curvarum omnium et solidorūum superficies et segmenta quævis contenta ex datis rectis vice versa ex his datis rectas determinari posse, et methodūum ibi indicatam illustraveram diversis seriebus. Suborta deinceps inter nos epistolari consuetudine, D. Collinsius vir in rem mathematicāam promovendam natus, non destitit suggerere ut hæc publici juris facerem: et ante annos quinqꝫue cum suadentibus amicis concilium cœperam edendi tractatūummtractatūum de refractione Lucis, et coloribus quem tunc in promptu habebam; cœpi de his seriebus iterum cogitare, et tractatum de ijs iterum etiam conscripsi, ut utrumqꝫue simul ederem. Sed ex occasione Telescopij Catadioptrici epistola ad te missâ. quâ breviter explicui conceptus meos de natura lucis, inopinatūum quiddam effecit ut mei interesse sentirem ad te festinanter scribere de impressione istius Epistolæ. Et subortæ statim per diversorūum epistolas Objectionibus aliisqꝫue refertas crebræ interpellationes me prorsus a consilio deterruerunt, et efficerunt ut me arguerem imprudentiæ quod umbram captando eatenus perdideram quietem meam rem prorsus substantialem. Sub id tempus Gregorius ex unica tantùm serie quadam e meis quam D. Collinsius ad eum transmiserat, post multam considerationem ut ad Collinsiūum rescripsit pervenit ad eandem methodum & tractatūum de ea reliquit quem spectamus speramus ab amicis ejus editum iri, siquidem pro ingenio ingenio quo pollebat non potuit non adjicere de suo multa quæ rei mathematicæ interest ut non pereant ipse autem tractatum meum non penitus absolveram ubi destiti a proposito, neque in hunc usque diem mens rediit ad reliqua adjicienda. Deerat quippe pars illa qua decreveram explicare modum solvendi Problemata quæ ad Quadraturas reduci nequeunt licet aliquid de fundamento ejus posuissem. Cæterum in tractatu ipso isto series infinitæ non magnam partem obtinebant Alia haud pauca congessi, inter quæ erat methodus ducendi tangentes quam Solertissimus Slusius ante annos duos tresve tibi communicavit, de quâ tu, suggerente Collinsio, rescripsisti eandem mihi ibi inno etiam innotuisse. Diversa ratione in eam incidimus. Nam res non eget demonstratione prout ego operor. Habito meo fundamento nemo potuit tangentes aliter ducere, nisi volens de recta viâ deviaret. Quinetiâ non hic hæretur ad æquationes radicalibus unam vel utramqꝫue indefinitāam quantitatem involventibus utcunqꝫue affectas, Sed absqꝫue aliquâ talium æquationūum reductione (quæ opus plerumqꝫue redderet immensūum) tangens confestim ducitur. et eodem modo se res habet in quæstionibus de Maximis et Minimis, alijsqꝫue quibusdam de quibus jam non loquor. Fundamentum harūum operationūum Fundamentum harūum operationum satis obvium quidem, quoniam jam non possuntm explicationem ejus prosequi sic potius celavi. 6accdæ13eff7i3l9n4o4qrr4s8f12vx. Hoc fundamento conatus sum etiam reddere speculationes de Quadratura curvarum simpliciores, perveniqꝫue ad Theoremata quædam generalia. et ut candide agam ecce primum Theorema. Ad cCurvāam aliquam sit d⁢zθ×e+f⁢zη|‾λ ordinatim applicata termino diametri seu basis z normaliter insistens: ubi literæ d, e, f denotant quaslibet quantitates datas, & θ, η, λ indices potestatūum sive dignitatum quantitatūum quibus affixæ sunt. Fac θ+1η=r. λ+r=s. dη⁢f×e+f⁢zη|‾λ+1=Q. & r⁢η−η=π, & area Curvæ erit Qinzπs−r−1s−1×e⁢Af⁢zη+r−2s−2×e⁢Bf⁢zη−r−3s−3×e⁢Cf⁢zη+r−4s−4×e⁢Df⁢zη&c literis A,B,C,D&c deino denotantibus terminos proximè antecedentes, nempe A terminum zπs, B terminum −r−1s−1×e⁢Af⁢zη &c. Hæc series ubi r fractio est vel numerus negativus continuatur in infinitum: ubi vero r integer est et affirmativus continuatur ad tot terminos tantùm quot sunt unitates in eodem r, et sic exhibet geometricam quadraturam cCurvæ. Rem exemplis illustro. Ex. 1. Proponatur Parabola cujus ordinatim applicata sit a⁢z. Hæc in formam regulæ reducta fit z0×0+a⁢z1|‾12. Quare est d=1. θ=0. e=0. f=a. η=1. Adeoqꝫue r=1. s=112. Q=1a×a⁢z|‾32. π=0. et area quæsita 1a×a⁢z|‾32in1112, hoc est, 23⁢z⁢a⁢z. Et sic in genere si c⁢zη ponatur ordinatim applicata, prodibit area cη+1⁢zη+1 . Ex 2. Sit ordinatim applicata a4⁢zc4−2⁢c⁢c⁢z⁢z+z4 hæc per reductionem fit a4⁢z×c⁢c−z⁢z|‾−2, vel etiam a4⁢z−3×−1+c⁢c⁢z−2|‾−2. In priori casu est d=a4. θ=1. e=c⁢c. f=−1. η=2. λ=−2. Adeoqꝫue r=1. s=−1. Q=a4−2×c⁢c−z⁢z|‾−1 hoc est =−a42⁢c⁢c−2⁢z⁢z. π=0. Et area curvæ =Qinz0−1 id est =−a42⁢c⁢c−2⁢z⁢z. In secundo autem casu est d=a4. θ=−3 e=−1. f=c⁢c. η=−2. λ=−2. r=1. s=−1.

Quare cum r non sit numerus affirmativus, procedo ad alterūum casūum. Hic est d=a5. θ=−4. e=1. f=b. η=−1. λ=12. adeoqꝫue r=3. s=312. Q=a5−b× 1+b⁢z−1|‾32, seu =−a5⁢z+a5⁢bb⁢z⁢z ⁢z⁢z+b⁢z, π=−2.

Q=3⁢b−2⁢a× × c−a⁢z23|‾25. Quod si res non successisset in hoc casu π=23. Et area =Q×5⁢z237− 52×5⁢c−7⁢a, id est −30⁢a⁢b⁢z23+75⁢b⁢c28⁢a⁢a×c−a⁢z23|‾25. Quod si res non successisset in hoc casu, existente r vel fractione vel numero negavitivonegativo, tunc tentassem alterum casum purgando terminūum −a⁢z23 in ordinatim applicata a coefficiente z23, hoc est reducendo ordinatim applicatam ad hanc formam b⁢z−115×−a+c⁢z−23|‾−35. et si r in neutro casu fuisset numerus integer et affirmativus conclusissem curvam ex earum numero esse quæ non possunt Geometricè quadrari. Nam quantūum animadverto, hæc Regula exhibet in finitis æquationibus areas omniūum Geometricam quadraturaam admittentiūum Curvarūum, quarūum ordinatim applicatæ constant ex potestatibꝫus, radicibus, vel quibuslibet dignitatibus binomij cujuscunqꝫue. At quando hujusmodi Curva aliqua non potest Geometricè quadrari sunt ad manus alia Theoremata pro comparatione ejus cum Conicis Sectionibus vel saltem cūum alijs figuris simplicissimis quibuscūum potest comparari ad quod sufficit etiam hoc ipsūum unicūum jam descriptum Theorema. Sic et pro trinomijs etiam et alijs quibusdam Regulas quasdem continuavi. Sed in simplicioribus vulgoqꝫue celebratis figuris vix aliquid relatu dignūum reperi quod evasit aliorūum conatus, nisi fortè longitudo Cissoidis ejusmodi censeatur. Ea sic construitur. Sit VD Cissois, AV diameter circuli ad quem aptatur, V vertex, AF Asymptotons ejus, ac DB perpendiculare quodvis ad AV demissūum. Cum semiaxe AF=AV, et semiparametro AG=13⁢AV describatur Hyperbola FkK, et inter AB et AV sumpta AC media proportionali, erigantur ad C et V perpendicula Ck et VK Hyperbolæ occurrentia in k et K et agantur rectæ KT et kt tangentes Hyperbolam in eisdem K et k et occurrentes AV, in T ac t, et ad AV constituatur constituatur rectangulum AVnm æquale spatio TK, kt; et Cissoidis VD longitudo erit sextupla altitudinis Vn demonstratio perbrevis est, sed ad infinitas series redeo. Quamvis multa restent investiganda circa modos approximandi, et diversa serierum genera quæ possunt ad id conducere, tamen vix cum D. Tschurnhausio speraverim dari posse aut simpliciora aut magis generalia fundamenta reducendi quantitates ad hoc genus serierūum de quo agimus quam sunt divisiones, et extractiones radicūum quibus Leibnitius et ego utimur: saltem non generaliora quia pro dquadraturâ et Euthunsi Curvarum ac similibus, nullæ possunt dari series ex hisce simplicibus terminis Algebraicis, unicam tanta indefinita quantitatem involventibus constantes quas non licet hac methodo colligere nāam non possunt esse plures hujusmodi convergentes series ad idem determinandūum quàm sunt indefinitæ quantitates ex quarūum potestatibus series conflentur, et ego quidem ex adhibita quacunqꝫue indefinita quantitate seriem novi colligere et idem credo Leibnitio in potestate esse. nam quamvis mea methodo liberūum sit eligere pro conflanda serie quantitatem quamlibet indefinitāam a qua quæsitūum dependeat, et methodus quam ipse nobis communicavit determinata videatur ad electionem talium indefinitarum quantitatūum quibus opus commodè deduci potest ad fractiones quæ per solam divisionem evadant series infinitæ: tamen aliæ quæcunqꝫue indefinitæ quantitates pro seriebus conflandis adhiberi possunt per methodum istam quâ affectæ æquationes resolvuntur, dummodo resolvantur in proprijs terminis hoc est conficiendo seriem ex solis terminis quos æquatio involvit. Præterea non video cur dicatur his divisionibus et extractionibus Problemata resolvi per accidens siquidem hæ operationes eodem modo se habeant ad hoc genus Algebræ ac vulgares operationes Arithmeticæ ad Algebram vulgo notam. Quod autem ad simplicitatem methodi attinet, nolim fractiones et radicales absqꝫue præviâ reductione semper resolvi in series infinitas. Sed ubi perplexæ quantitates occurrunt tentandæ sunt omnimodæ reductiones, sive id fiat augendo, minuendo, multiplicando, vel dividendo quantitates indefinitas, sive per methodūum transmutatoriam Leibnitij aut alio quocunqꝫue modo qui occurrat. Et tunc resolutio in series per divisionēem et extractionem optimè adhibebitur. Hic autem præcipuè intendum est ut Denominatores fractionūum et quantitates in vinculo radicūum reducantur ad quam paucissimas et minimè compositas, & et ad tales etiam quæ in seriem abeant citissimè convergentēem, etsi radices neqꝫue convertantur in fractiones, neqꝫue deprimantur. Nam per regulāam initio alterius Epistolæ, extractio altissimarūum radicum æque simplex et facilis est ac extractio radicis quadraticæ vel divisio. et series quæ per divisionēem eliciuntur solent minimè omniūum convergere. Hactenus de seriebus, unicāam indefinitam quantitatem involventibus locutus sūum. Sed possunt etiam perspecta methodo series ex duabus vel pluribus assignatis definitis quantitatibus pro arbitrio confici. Quinetiam beneficio ejusdem methodi possunt series ad omnes figuras conduci efformari Gregorianis ad Circulum et Hyperbolāam editis persimiles affines, hoc est quarūum ultimus terminus exhibebit quæsitāam aream. Sed calculūum Folios 4-5 are a revision, in Newton's hand, of a passage beginning with the last two lines of f. 2v, and running through ff. 3r, 3v, 6r, 6v and 7r of the document as currently paginated. The revised passage appears to have been inserted between two of the pages (ff. 3v and 6r) of the text it is intended to replace. It ends 'morem meum universaliter usurpandi li' and dovetails into the same text string in the fourth paragraph of f. 7r. π=0. Et Area =Qinz01 hoc est =a4⁢z⁢z2⁢c4−2⁢c⁢c⁢z⁢z. Area his casibus diversimode exhibetur computatur a diversis finibus, quorum assignatio per hos inventos valores arearum facilis est. Ex. 3.

Et erit in priori casu d=a5. θ=−92. e=b. f=1. η=1. λ=12. adeoqꝫue r=−72 &c. Quare cùm r non sit numerus affirmativus, procedo ad alterum casum.

Q=3⁢b−2⁢a××c−a⁢z23|‾25, π=23. Et area =Q×5⁢z237−52×5⁢c−7⁢a, id est −30⁢a⁢b⁢z23+75⁢b⁢c28⁢a⁢a×c−a⁢z23|‾25. Quod si res non successisset in hoc casu, existente r vel fractione vel numero negativo, tunc tentassem alterum casum purgando terminum −a⁢z23 in ordinatim applicata a coefficiente z23, hoc est reducendo ordinatim applicatam ad hanc formam b⁢z−115×−a+c⁢z−23|‾−35. Et si r in neutro casu fuisset numerus integer & affirmativus, conclusissem curvam ex earum numero esse quæ non possunt geometricè quadrari. Nam quantum animadverto, hæc Regula exhibet in finitis æquationibus areas omnium geometricam quadraturam admittentium Curvarum, quarum ordinatim applicatæ constant ex potestatibus, radicibus, vel quibuslibet dignitatibus binomij cujuscunque. At quando hujusmodi Curva aliqua non potest Geometricè quadrari, sunt ad manus alia Theoremata pro comparatione ejus cum Conicis Sectionibus, vel saltem cum alijs figuris simplicissimis quibuscum potest comparari. Sic et pro trinomijs & alijs quibusdam Regulas quasdem concinnavi. Sed in simplicioribus vulgoqꝫue celebratis figuris vix quo aliquid relatu dignum reperi quod evasit conatus aliorum, nisi fortè longitudo Cissoidis ejusmodi censeatur. Ea verò sic construitur. Sit VD Cissois, AV diameter circuli ad quem aptatur, V vertex, AF Asymptoton ejus, ac DB perpendiculare quodvis ad AV demissum. Cum semiaxe AF=AV, et semiparametro AG=13⁢AV, describatur Hyperbola FkK, et inter AB et AV sumpta AC media proportionali, erigantur ad C et V perpendicula Ck et VK Hyperbolæ occurrentia in k et K et agantur rectæ KT et kt tangentes Hyperbolam in ijsdem K et k et occurrentes AV in T ac t, et ad AV constituatur rectangulum AVnm æquale spatio TKkt; et Cissoidis VD longitudo erit sextupla altitudinis Vn. Demonstratio perbrevis est. Sed ad infinitas series redeo. Vix cum D. Tschunhausio speraverim dari posse aut simpliciora aut magis generalia fundamenta reducendi quantitates ad has serieres quam sunt divisiones et extractiones radicum quibus Leibnitius & ego utimur utimur: saltem non generaliora quia pro quadratura et eutheunsi curvarum ac similibus, nullæ possunt dari series ex hisce simplicibus terminis Algebraicis, unicam tanta indefinita quantitatem involventibus constantes quas non licet hac methodo colligere. Nam non possunt esse plures hujusmodi convergentes series pro eodem quæsito determinando quantitates ex quarum potestatibus series conflentur, et ego quidem ex adhibita quacunque indefinita quantitate (lineam rectam intelligo quon cujus longitudine area determinatur seriem novi colligere et idem credo Leibnitio in potestate esse. Nam quamvis mea methodo liberum sit eligere pro conflanda serie quantitatem quamlibet indefinitam a cujus assumptione quantitas quæsita redditur determinata redditur a qua quæsitum dependeat, et methodus quam ipse nobis communicavit determinata videatur ad electionem talium indefinitarum quantitatūum quibus opus commodè deducitur ad fractiones quæ per solam divisionem evadunt series infinitæ: tamen aliæ quæcunqꝫue indefinitæ quantitates pro seriebus conflandis adhiberi possunt per methodum istam qua affectæ æquationes resolvuntur, dummodo methodus illa semper resolvāantur æquationes in proprijs terminis, hoc est conficiendo seriem ex solis terminis quos æquatio involvit. Præterea non video cur dicatur his divisionibus et extractionibus Problemata resolvi per accidens, siquidem hæ operationes eodem modo se habeant ad hoc genus Algebræ, ac vulgares operationes Arithmeticæ ad Algebram vulgo notam. Quod verò ad simplicitatem methodi attinet nolim fractiones et radicales absqꝫue prævia reductione semper resolvi in series infinitas. Regulæ non solent sic adhiberi. Sed ubi perplexæ quantitates occurrunt tentandæ sunt omnimodæ reductiones, sive id fiat augendo, minuendo, multiplicando, vel dividendo quantitates indefinitas, sive per methodum transmutatoriam Leibnitij aut alio quocunqꝫue modo qui occurrat: et tunc vix speranda erit reductio resolutio in series per divisionem et extractionem optimè succedunt adhibetur. Dum verò locutus sum de prævijs reductionibus, non intendo ut radices semper deprimantur, ad humiliores vel reducantur ad fractiones, (Nam per Regulam initio alterius Epistolæ positam, extractio altissimarum radicum æque simplex et facilis est ac extractio radicis quadraticæ vel divisio, et series quæ per divisionem eliciuntur solent minimè omnium minùs convergere:) Et proinde sufficit hoc tantum requiro tantum ut denominatores fractionum et quantitates in vinculo radicum reducantur ad quam paucissimas et minimè compositas, et ad tales etiam quæ in seriem abeant citissimè convergentem. Hactenus locutus de seriebus unicam indefinitam quantitatem involventibus locutus sum: sed possunt etiam perspectâ methodo series ex duabus vel pluribus assignatis definitis quantitatibus pro arbitrio confici. Quinetiam beneficio ejusdem methodi possunt series ad omnes figuras efformari Gregorianis ad cCirculum et Hyperbolam editis persimiles; hoc est quarum ultimus terminus exhibebit quæsitam aream. Sed calculum hic onerosiorem nolim lubens subire. Præsertim cum In hacce etiam rerum varietate hoc etiam nobis desit, ut ante calculum semper sciamus eligere meliora, et in series citissimè omnium convergentes incidere. Ex eo quod D. Tschurnhausius desiderat in nostris seriem pro determinando arcu ex data Tangente, credo eum vix animadvertisse solutionem Problematis istius neutiquam per meam methodum neutiquam difficiliorem esse quam determinationes arcuum ex sinu recto et verso quas posui5 posui: descriptionem omnium particularium sed sed in am et alteram in diversis rerum generibus conducere ad ostendandam universalitatem computi ad contenta et superficies solidorum (qu ferè generis ac difficultatis) satis putab posui tantùm con segmenti cujusdam Elliptici: ad cujus computi methodum Gregorius etiam de suo pervenit, & seriem ad me transmitti curavit. Similiter ad curvas Mechanicas instantia in Quadratrice sufficere videbatur: & ad areas Geometricarum curvarum deliegi delegi astronomicum Problema Kepleri, missis facilioribus et elegantioribus seriebus quibus segmenta conicarum Sectionum exhibentur: Et hoc Problema non nisi in unico casu solvi; cùm tamen diversæ ejusmodi series ad diversas partes Ellipseos aptari deberent siquis inde vellet computare Tabulas Astronomicas. Sed et ad sectionem angulorum in data ratione (quod est Problema cæteris nobilius) dedi tantum instantiam in sectione per chordas, propterea quod series pro sectione per sinus versos & tangentes et secantes vel per sinus rectas et versos mixtummixtis eruuntur. Et proinde non est quod heæreatis ad omissionem præfatæ seriei: cujus computum utiqꝫue ex facillimis est, & quæ (meo saltem judicio) utilitate cedit istis quas posuit. Illud enim revera simplicius est quod Problema minore labore solvit. Sic quamvis hæc æquatio x3−x=1 appareat simplicior hacce y⁢y−2⁢y⁢8125−20=20, tamen in confesso est posteriorem revera simpliciorem esse propterea quod radicem ejus y Geometra facilius eruit. Et eadem rationem series pro obtinendis arcubus circuli, vel (quod eodem recidit) pro obtinendo sectore per sinum rectum versumve simpliciores haberi debent quam series pro obtinendo eodem sectore per Tangentem. Nam si e.g. posito radio 1 velis arcum 45gr ex tangente eruere ad usqꝫue 15 loca figurarum, opus esset 500000000000 500000000000000 terminis circiter, huius seriei 1−13+15−17+19&c si integros terminos ejus semper adjeceris, vel dimidio numero seriei 13+135+199+1195&c quorum computo milleni anni requirerentur. At si eundem arcum ex sinu recto ad eundem locorum numerum velis computare, quadraginta termini seriei huius 12×1+112+3160+5896‾&c sufficerent: quorum computatio vix ultra duos tresve dies ut conjicio requireret. Et tamen hic non est optimus modus computandi totam peripheriam. Nam series ex sinu recto triginta graduum vel ex sinu verso sexaginta graduum conflata, multò citiùs dabit arcum suum, cujus sextuplum vel duodecuplum; est tota perifpheria. Idem fit per cosecantem arcus 30gr ope hujus seriei r⁢rx+r46⁢x3+3⁢r640⁢x5+5⁢r8112⁢x7&c, ubi r denotat radium, et x cosecantem arcûs per seriem expressi. Neqꝫue minori labore eruitur area totius Circuli ex segmento cujus sagitta est quadrans diametri. Ejus computi specimen siquidem ad manus est, visum fuit apponere; & una adjungere aream Hyperbolæ siquidem quæ eodem calculo proderit. Posito axe transverso =1 et sinu verso seu segmenti sagitta =x. Erit 12 segmentum HyperbolæCirculi} =x12in23⁢x±x⁢x5−x328±x472‾&c. Hæc autem series sic in infinitum producitur. Sit 2x32=a. a⁢x2=b. b⁢x4=c. 3⁢c⁢x6=d. 5⁢d⁢x8=e. 7⁢e⁢x10=f. &c. Et erit 12 segmentum Hyperbolæcirculi} =a3±b5−c7±d9−e11±f13&c, eorumqꝫue semisummama a3−c7−e11 &c et semidifferentia b5 +d9+f13&c. His ita præparatis suppono x esse 14 quadrantem nempe axis et prodit a14= 0.25. b=a⁢x2=0.251×8 =0.03125. c=b⁢x4=0.031252×8=0.001953125. d=3⁢c⁢x6=0.0019531258=0.000244140625. Et sic procedo usqꝫue dum venero ad terminum depressimum qui potest ingredi opus. Deinde hos terminos per 3,5,79,11&c divisos dispono in duas tabulas, affirmativos ambiguos in unam et negativos ambiguos negativos in aliāam et addo ut hic vides. +0.0833333333333333 ±0,0062500000000000 0,0000271267361111 0,0000005135169396 0,0000000144628917 0,0000000004954581 0,0000000000190948 0,0000000000007963 0,0000000000000352 0,0000000000000016 0,0000000000000001 0.0896109885646618 00000000 −0.0002790178571429 0,0000034679066051 0,0000000834465027 0,0000000026285354 0,0000000000961296 0,0000000000038676 0,0000000000001663 0,0000000000000075 0,0000000000000004 0.0002825719389575 Dein a priori summa aufero posteriorem et restat 0.0893284166257043 area semi-segmenti Hyperbolici Addo etiam easdem summas & aggregatum aufero a primo termino duplicato 0.1666666666666666 et restat 0.0767731061630473 area semi-segmenti circularis. Huic addo triangulum istud quo completur in sectorem, hoc est triangulum 132⁢3 seu 0.0541265877365274, Et habeo sectorem 60 graduum 0.1308996938995747, cujus sextuplum 0.7853981633974482, est area totius circuli, quæ divisa per 14 quadrantem diametri dat totam peripheriam 3,1415926535897928. Si alias artes adhibuissem potui per eundem numerum terminorum seriei pervenisse ad multa plura loca figurarum puta viginti quinqꝫue aut amplius; sed animus fuit hic ostendere quid per simplex seriei computum præstari posset: quod sanè haud difficile est cùm in omni opere multiplicatores ac divisores magna ex parte non majores quam 11 & nunquam majores quam 41 adhibere opus sit. Per seriem Leibnitij etiam, si ultimo loco dimidium termini adijciatur & alia quædam similia artificia adhibeantur, potest computum produci ad multas figuras. Sed optimus ejus usus est quando vel conjungitur cum duabus alijs persimilibus et citissime convergentibus seriebus, vel sola adhibetur ad computandum arcum 30grad. posita tangente 13. Tunc enim series illa evadit 1−13×3+15×9−17×27+19×81&c3, quæ citò convergit. Vel si conjunges cum alijs seriebus, pone circuli diametrum =1 & a=12, et area totius circuli erit a1−a33+a55−a77+&c+a21 +a53−a85−a117+a14 9+a1711−a2013−a2315+&c+a41−a103+a165−a227+a289−&c. Hic consideravimus series quatenus adhibentur ad computandum totum circulum. Sed quando computandæ sunt partes ejus, tunc quælibet series habet proprium usum et in suo genere optimus est. Si datur Tangens haud recurrendum erit ad sinum aliquem ut inde computetur arcus, neqꝫue vice versa dato sinu quærenda erit Tangens. Sed Series dato congruens adhibenda erit, tanquam est æquatio pro solvendo proprio problemata. Credo Cl. Leibnitium vix animum advertisse seriei meæ pro determinatione sinus versi ex dum posuit seriem pro determinatione cosinus ex arcu dato, vix animum advertisse seriei meam pro determinatione sinus versi ex eodem area, siquidem hæc idem sunt. Neqꝫue observasse videtur morem meum generaliter usurpandi literas 6 Here Newton's intervention ends and the original text resumes, following on directly from the end of f. 3v. calculūum hic onerosiorem nolim lubens subire. Possunt deniqꝫue series ex terminis compositis eadem methodo constitui Quemadmodūum si sit a⁢a−a⁢x+x3a ordinatim applicata curvæ alicujus pone a⁢a−a⁢x=z⁢z et ex binomio z⁢z−x3a extractâ radice prodibit z+x32⁢a⁢x−x68⁢a⁢a⁢z3 &c. cujus seriei omnes termini quadrari possunt per Theorema jam ante descriptūum. Sed hæc minoris facio quod ubi series simplices non sunt satis tractabiles, aliam nondum communicatam methodum habeo qua pro lubitu acceditur ad quæsitūum. Ejus fundamentum est commoda expedita et generalis solutio hujus Problematis Curvam Geometricam describere quæ per data quodcunqꝫue puncta transibit. Docuit Euclides descriptionem cCirculi per tria data puncta. Potest etiam Conica sectio describi per quinque data puncta & Curva trium dimensionūum per octo data puncta, adeo ut in potestate habeam descriptionem omniūum curvarūum istius ordinis quæ per octo tantùm puncta determinantur. Hæc statim Geometricè fiunt nullo calculo interposito: Sed superius Problema est alterius generis. et quamvis prima fronte intractabile videatur; tamen res aliter se habet. est enim fere ex pulcherrimis quæ solvere desiderem. Seriei a D. Leibnitio pro quadratura Conicarūum Sectionūum propositæ affinia sunt Theoremata quædam quæ pro comparatione Curvarūum cum Conicis sectionibus in Catalogūum dudūum retuli. Possum utiqꝫue cūum Conicis sectionibus geometricè comparare curvas omnes numero infinitas quarūum ordinatim applicatæ sunt d⁢zη−1e+f⁢zη+g⁢z2⁢η vel d⁢z2⁢η−1e+f⁢zη+g⁢z2⁢η &c. Aut d⁢z12⁢η−1e+f⁢zη+g⁢z2⁢η vel d⁢z32⁢η−1e+f⁢zη+g⁢z2⁢η &c. Aut dz⁢e+f⁢zη+g⁢z2⁢η vel d⁢zη−1×e+f⁢zη+g⁢z2⁢η &c. Aut d⁢zη−1e+f⁢zη+g⁢z2⁢η vel d⁢z2⁢η−1e+f⁢zη+g⁢z2⁢η &c. Aut d⁢zη−1×e+f⁢zηg+h⁢zη. vel d⁢z2⁢η−1×e+f⁢zηg+h⁢zη &c Aut d⁢zη−1g+h⁢zη‾×e+f⁢zη, vel d⁢z2⁢η−1g+h⁢zη‾×e+f⁢zη &c. Aut dz⁢e+f⁢zηg+h⁢zη vel d⁢zη−1×e+f⁢zηg+h⁢zη &c Hic d, e, f, g significant quasvis datas quantitates cum suis signis + et − affectas, z axem vel basem Curvæ, et η, 2⁢η, 12⁢η−1, 32⁢η−1, η−1, 2⁢η−1 indices potestatum vel dignitatūum z sive sint affirmativi, vel negativi, sive integri vel fracti; et singula bina Theoremata sunt duo primi termini seriei in infinitūum progredientis. In tertio et quarto 4⁢e⁢g debet esse non magis majus quam f⁢f nisi e et g sint contrarij signi in cæteris nulla est limitatio. Horum aliqua (nempe secundūum, tertium, quartum, quintūum et decimum tertium) ex areis duarūum Conicarūum Sectionum conjunctis constant. Alia quædam ut nonum decimūum et duodecimum, sunt aliter satis composita: et omnia quidem in continuatione & progressionūum citò evadunt compositissima: adeò ut vix per transmutationes figurarūum quibus Gregorius et alij usi sunt absqꝫue ulteriori fundamento inveniri posse putem. Ego equidem haud quicquam generale in has his obtinere potui antequam abstraherem a contemplatione figurarūum et rem totāam ad simplicem considerationem solarūum ordinatim applicatarūum reducerem sed cūum hæc et his longè generaliora sint in potestate, non dubitabitur credo de binomialibus longe facilioribus quæ in his continentur & prodeunt ponendo tantūum literam aliquāam e vel f g=0, et η=1 vel 2: etsi series in quas ista resolvuntur non posuerim in in epistola priori, intentus non in omnia particularia enumeranda, sed in illustrandam methodūum per unam et alteram in singulis rerum generibus instantiam quæ ad ostendendam ejus generalitatem sufficere videbatur. Cæterūum hæc Theoremata dant series plusquam uno modo nam primum si ponatur f=0 et η=1 evadit de+g⁢z⁢z: unde prodit series nobis communicata, sed si ponatur 2⁢e⁢g=f⁢f et η=1, inde tandem obtinemus hanc seriem 1+13−15−17+19+111−113−115+&c pro longitudine quadrantalis arcus cujus chorda est unitas, vel quod perinde est hanc 12+115−163+1143&c pro longitudine dimidii ejus. et has fortè quia æque simplices sunt ac alteræ, et magis convergunt, non repudiabitis. Sed ego rem aliter æstimo . Illud enim melius quod utilius est et problema minori labore solvit. Sic quamvis hæc æquatio x3−x=1 appareat simplicior hacce y⁢y−2⁢y⁢8125−20=20 tamen in confesso est posteriorem esse revera simpliciorēem propterea quod radicem ejus y Geometra facilius eruit. et ob hanc rationem series pro obtinendis arcubus circuli, vel (quod eodem recidit) pro obtinendis sectoribus conicarūum Sectionum, pro optimis habeo quæ componuntur ex potestatibus sinuum. Nam siquis vellet per simplex computum hujus seriei 1+13−15−17+19+&c colligere longitudinem quadrantis ad viginti figurarum loca decimalia, opus esset 5000000000 terminis seriei circiter, ad quorūum calculūum milleni anni requirerentur: & res tardius obtineretur ꝑper tangentem 45 grad. juxta seriem Leibnitij nobis communicatam Sed adhibito sinu recto 45 grad quinquaginta quinqꝫue vel sexaginta termini hujus seriei 12×1+112+3160+5896&c‾ sufficerent, quorūum computatio tribus ut opinor vel quatuor diebus absolvi posset. Et tamen hic non est optimus modus computandi totam Peripheriam nam series ex sinu recto triginta graduum vel ex sinu verso sexaginta graduum conflata, multò citiùs dabit arcūum suum cujus sextuplum vel duodecuplūum est tota peripheria. Neqꝫue minori labore eruitur area totius cCirculi ex segmento cujus sagitta est quadrans diametri. Ejus computi specimen, siquidem ad manus est, visūum fuit apponere & unâ adjungere aream Hyperbolæ quæ eodem calculo prodit. Posito axe transverso =1, et sinu verso seu segmenti sagitta =x erit semisegmentūum HyperbolæCirculi} =x12in23⁢x±x⁢x5−x328±x472‾&c. Hæc autem series sic in infinitūum producitur. Sit 2x32=a. a⁢x2=b. b⁢x4=c. 3⁢c⁢x6=d. 5⁢d⁢x8=e. 7⁢e⁢x10=f &c et erit semisegm. Hyperbolæcirculi} =a3±b5−c7±d9−e11±f13&c eorumqꝫue semisumma a3−c7−e11 &c et semidifferentia b5+d9+f13&c. His ita præparatis suppono x esse 14 quadrantem nempe axis et prodit a14= 0.25. b=a⁢x2=0.251×8 =0.03125. c=b⁢x4=0.031252×8=0.001953125. d=3⁢c⁢x6=0.0019531258=0.000244140625. Et sic procedo usqꝫue dum venero ad terminūum depressimum qui potest ingredi opus. Deinde hos terminos per 3,5,79,11&c respectivè divisos dispono in duas tabulas, ambiguos cūum primo in unam et negativos in aliam et addo ut hic vides 0,0833333333333333 0,0062500000000000 0,0000271267361111 0,0000005135169396 0,0000000144628917 0,0000000004954581 0,0000000000190948 0,0000000000007963 0,0000000000000352 0,0000000000000016 0,0000000000000001 00000000 0,0002790178571429 0,0000034679066051 0,0000000834465027 0,0000000026285354 0,0000000000961296 0,0000000000038676 0,0000000000001663 0,0000000000000075 0,0000000000000004 7 0,0896109885646618000000000,0002825719389575 Tunc a priori summma aufero posteriorem et restat 0,0893284166257043 area semisegmenti Hyperbolici. Addo etiam easdem summas & aggregatum aufero a primo termino duplicato 0.1666666666666666, et restat 0.0767731061630473 area semisegmenti circularis &c huic addo triangulūum istud quo completur in sectorem, hoc est triangulūum 132⁢3, seu 0,0541265877365274, & habeo sectorem sexaginta graduūum 0,1308996938995747, cujus sextuplum 0,7853981633974482 est area totius circuli, quæ divisa per 14 quadrantem diametri dat totāam peripheriam 3,1415926535897928. Si alias artes adhibuissem potui per eundem numerūum terminorūum seriei potuisse pervenisse ad multa plura loca figurarūum, puta viginti quinqꝫue aut amplius; sed animus fuit hic ostendere quid per simplex seriei computūum præstari posset: Quod sanè haud difficile est cùm in omni opere multiplicatores ac divisores magnâ ex parte non majores quàm 11 & nunquam majores quàm 41 adhibere opus sit. Per seriem Leibnitij etiam si ultimo log co dimidiūum termini adijciatur, et alia quædam similia artificia adhibeantur, potest computum produci ad multas figuras. ut et ponendo summam terminorum 1−17+19−115+117−123+125−131+133&c esse ad totam seriem 1−13+15−17+19−111&c, ut 1+2 ad 2 Sed optimus ejus usus videtur esse quando vel conjungitur cūum duabus alijs persimilibus et citissimè convergentibus seriebus, vel sola adhibetur ad computandūum arcum 30 grad. posita tangente 13. Tunc enim series illa evadit 1−13×3+15×9−17×27+19×81&c3, quæ citò convergit vel si conjunges cum alijs seriebus, pone circuli diametrum =1 & a=12 & area totius circuli erit a1−a33+a55−a77+&c+a⁢a1+a53−a85−a117+a14 9+a1711−&c+a41−a103+a165−a227+a289+&c. Hic consideravimus series quatenus adhibentur ad computandūum totūum circulum. Sed quando computandæ sunt partes ejus, tunc quælibet series habet proprium usum & in suo genere optima est. Si datur Tangens satis parva, vel satis magna, non recurrendum erit ad sinum aliquem ut inde computetur arcus, neqꝫue vice versâ. Series dato congruens est æquatio pro solvendo proprio problemate. Credo Cl. Leibnitiūum, dum posuit seriem pro determinatione cosinus ex arcu dato, vix animūum advertisse ad seriem meam pro determinatione sinus versi ex eodem arcu siquidem hæc idem sunt. Neqꝫue observasse videtur morem meum generaliter usurpandi literasAt this point, Newton's revised text on ff. 4-5 rejoins the main text. pro quantitatibus cum signis suis + et − affectis, dum dividit hanc seriem zb+z⁢z2⁢a⁢b⁢b+z36⁢a⁢a⁢b3+z424⁢a3⁢b4+&c. Nam cum area Hyperbolicâ BE hic significata per z sit affirmativa vel negativa prout jaceat ex una vel altera parte ordinatim applicatæ BC; si area illa in numeris data sit l, & l substituatur in serie pro z, orietur vel lb+l⁢l2⁢a⁢b⁢b+l36⁢a⁢a⁢b3+l424⁢a3⁢b4&c vel −lb+l⁢l2⁢a⁢b⁢b−l36⁢a⁢a⁢b3+l424⁢a3⁢b4 &c prout l sit affirmativa vel negativa. Hoc est posito a=1=b et l logarithmo Hyperbolico: numerus ei correspondens erit 1+l1+l⁢l2+l33+l44&c si l sit affirmativus, et 1−l1+l⁢l2−l36+l424&c si l sit affirmativus negativus. Hoc modo fugio multiplicationem Theorematum quæ alias in nimiam molem crescerent. Nam v.g. illud unicum Theorema quod supra posui pro quadratura Curvarūum resolvendūum esset in triginta duo Theoremata si pro signorūum varietate multiplicaretur. Præterea quæ habentur de inventione numeri unitate majoris per datūum Logarithmum Hyperbolicum ope seriei l1−l⁢l1×2+l31×2×3−l41×2×3×4+&c potius quam ope seriei l1+l⁢l1×2+l31×2×3+l41×2×3×4+&c mihi quidem haud ita eam sunt. Nam si unus terminus adjiciatur amplius ad seriem posteriorem quam ad priorem posterior magis appropinquabit. Et certè minor est labor computare unam vel duas primas figuras adjecti hujus termini quāam dividere unitatem per prodeuntem logarithmūum Hyperbolicūum ad multa figurarūum loca extensum, ut inde obtineatur Logarithmus Hyperbolicus quæsitus. quæsitus Utraqꝫue igitur series (si duas dicere fas est sit) officio suo fungatur Potest tamen l1+l31×2×3+l51×2×3×4×5+&c series ex dimidiá parte terminorūum constans optimè adhiberi siquidem hæc dabit semidifferentiam duorum numerorūum ex qua et rectangulo dato uterqꝫue datur. Sic & ex serie l1+l⁢l1×2+l41×2×3×4 &c datur semisumma numerorum indeqꝫue etiam numeri. Unde prodit relatio serierūum inter se quâ ex unâ datâ dabitur altera. Theorema de inventione arcûs ex dato cosinu, ponendo radium 1, cosinum c, & arcum 6−24⁢c+12, minus appropinquat quàm prima fronte videtur. Posito quidem sinu verso v, error erit v390+v4194+&c. Potest fieri ut 120−27⁢v ad 120−17⁢v ita chorda 2⁢v ad arcum, et error erit tantūum 61⁢v3⁢2044800 circiter qui semper minor est quam 514 minuta secunda, dum arcus non sit major quàm 45gr. & singulis etiam bisectionibus diminuitur 128 vicibus Series a31×2×3−a51×2×3×4×5+a71×2×3×4×5×6×7&c applicari posset ad computationem Tabulæ segmentorūum ut observat vir cClarissimus, sed res optimè absolvitur per Canonem sinuum. Utpote cognitâ quadrantis areâ, per continuas additionēem nonæ partis ejus habebis sectores ad singulos decem gradus in semicirculo, dein per continuam additionem decimæ partis partis hujus habebis sectores ad gradus: et sic ad decimas partes graduum et ultra procedi procedi potest. Eodem modo Leibnitius collegit seriem a31×2×3−a51×2×3×4×5. Tunc, radio existente 1, ab uno quoqꝫue sectore et ejus complemento ad 180gr aufer dimidium communis sinus recti & relinquentur segmenta in Tabulam referenda. Cæterum quamvis series hic non prosint, in alijs tamen locum obtinent; et quoniam hoc ad earūum usum spectat, non gravabor in aliquibus attingere. Constructionem Logarithmorum non aliunde peti debere, credetis fortè ex hoc simplici processu qui ab istis pendet. Per methodum supra traditam quærantur Logarithmi Hyperbolici numerorum 10, 0.98, 0.99, 1.01, 1.02: id quod fit spatio unius et alterius horæ. dein divisis Logarithmis quatuor posteriorum per Logarithmum numeri 10, & addito indice 2, prodibunt veri Logarithmi numerorūum 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, in Tabulam inserendi. Hi per dena intervalla interpolandi sunt, et exibunt Logarithmi omnium numerorum inter 980. & 1020 & omnibus inter 980 et 1000 iterum per dena intervalla interpolatis habebitur Tabula eatinus constructa. Tunc ex his colligendi erunt Logarithmi omnium primorum numerorūum et eorūum multiplicium minorum quàm 100: ad quod nihil requiritur præter additionem et substractionēem siquidem sit ⑩9984×10209945=2. ④8×9963984=3. 102=5. 982=7. 999=11. 10017×11=13. 1026=17. 9884×13=19. 993616×27=23. 9862×17=29. 99232=31. 99927=37. 98424=41. 98923=43. 98727=47. 991111×17=53. 997113×13= 59. 98822×81=61. 98493×49=67. 99414=71. 99288×17=73. 99547×18 =79. 99612=83. 99687×16=89. 98946×17=97 et habitis sic Logarithmis omnium numerorum minorum quàm 100, restat tantùm hos etiam semel atqꝫue iterum per dena intervalla interpolare. Constructionis Tabulæ sinuum a qua pendet tota res Trigonometrica fundamentum optimūum est continua additio dati anguli ad seipsum vel ad alium datum. Utpote in angulo addendo BAE inscribantur HI, IK, KL, LM, MN, NO, OP, &c8 &c æquales radio AB: et ad opposita latera demittantur perpendicula BE, HQ, IR, KS, LT, MV, NX, OY, &c. et angulorum HIQ, IKH, KLI, LMK &c differentiæ erunt angulus A, sinus HQ, IR, KS &c. et cosinus IQ, KR, LS, &c. detur jam aliquis eorum LMK. et cæteri sic eruentur. Ad SV, et MV demitte perpendicula Ta & Kb, et propter similia triangula ABE, TLa, KMb, ALT, AMV &c erit AB.BE∷TL.La=SL−LV2.KT12⁢KM.12⁢Mb=MV−KS2. Et AB.AE∷KT.Sa=00 SL+LV2∷TL.Ta=KS+MV2. Unde dantur sinus et cosinus KS, MV, SL, LV, et simul patet ratio continuandi progressiones. Nempe AB.2⁢AE∷LV.TM +MX∷MX.VN+NY &c ∷MV.TL+XN∷XN∶MV+OY &c. Vel AB.2⁢BE∷LV.XN−TL∷MV.TM−MX∷MX.OY−MV∷XN.VN−NY &c et retro AB.2⁢AE∷LS.KT+RK &c. + Pone ergo AB=1, et fac BE×TL=La, AE×KT=Sa. Sa−La=LV. 2⁢AE+LV−TM=MX, &c. Sed nodus est inventio sinus et cosinus anguli A. Et hic subveniunt series nostræ. Utpote cognito ex superioribus Quadrantalis arcus longitudine 1.57079 &c et simul quadrato ejus 2.4694 &c; divide quadratūum hoc per quadratum numeri exprimentis rationem 90gr ad angulum A: et quoto dicto z, tres vel quatuor primi termini huius seriei 1−z2+z⁢z24−z3720+z440320&c dabunt cosinūum istius anguli A. Sic primo quæri potest angulus 5gr et inde Tabula computari ad quinos gradus, ac deinde interpolari ad gradus vel dimidios gradus per eandem methodum: nam non convenit progredi per nimios saltus. Duæ tertiæ partes Tabulæ sic computatæ dant reliquam tertiam partem per additionem vel substractionem more noto, siquidem posito KT cosinu 60gr sit AE=SV et BE=Mb. Tunc ad decimas et centesimas partes graduūum pergendum est per aliam methodum, substitutis tamen prius Logarithmis sinuum inventorūum si ejus generis Tabula desideretur. Ad computum Tabularum Astronomicarūum Kepleri posui fundamentūum quoddam in alterâ Epistola. Ejus seriei tres primi termini et aliquando duo sufficiunt. Sed ad diversas partes Ellipseos diversæ ejusmodi series aptari debent. Vel potiùs tales series computandæ sunt quæ ex data area sectoris Ellipticæ BGE, immediatè exhibeant aream sectoris circuli cujus angulus est BEG, radius CB. Et habitis hisce, computūum earum ad duos tres vel fortè quatuor terminos beneficio Logarithmorūum haud gravius erit quam solita resolutio tot triangulorūum in alijs Hypothesibus: imo forte minùs grave si series prius debitè concinnentur. siquidem unus Logarithmus e Tabula petitus determinet omnes istos terminos addendo ipsum et ejus multiplices ad Logarithmos datorūum coefficientiūum in promptu habitos. Quæ de hoc genere Tabularūum dicuntur, ad alias transferri possunt ubi ratiocinia Geometrica locum non obtinent. sufficit autem per has series computare triginta, vel viginti vel aut fortè pauciores terminos Tabulæ in debitis distantijs, siquidem termini intermedij facilè interseruntur per Methodūum quandam quam in usu cCalculatorum ferè hic descripsissem. Sed pergo ad alia. Quæ Cl. Leibnitius a me desiderat explicanda, ex parte supra descripsi. Quod verò attinet ad inventionem terminorūum p, q, r, in extractione radicis affectæ, primum p sic eruo. Descripto angulo recto BAC, latera ejus ejusBA, AC divido in partes æquales et inde normales erigo distribuentes angulare spatium in æqualia parallelogramma vel quadrata, quæ concipio denominata esse a dimensionibus duarum indefinitarūum specierum, puta x et y, regulariter ascendentium a termino A prout vides in fig. 1 inscriptas: ubi y denotat radicem extrahendāam et x alteram indefinitam quantitatem ex cujus potestatibus series constituenda est. Deinde cùm æquatio aliqua proponitur, parallelogramma singulis ejus terminis correspondentia insignio nota aliquâ: et Regulâ ad duo vel fortè plura ex insignitis parallelogrammis applicatâ quorūum unum sit humillimūum in columna sinistrâ juxta AB: et alia ad regulam dextrorsūum sita, cæteraqꝫue omnia non contingentia Regulam supra eam jaceant: seligo terminos æquationis per parallelogramma contingentia Regulam designatos et inde quæro quantitatem Quotienti addendam. Sic ad extrahendam radicem y ex y6−5⁢x⁢y5+x3a⁢y4−7⁢a2⁢x2⁢y2+6⁢a3⁢x3+b⁢b⁢x4=0; parallelogramma hujus terminis respondentia signo notâ aliqua ∗ ut vides in fig. 2. Dein applico Regulam DE ad inferiorem e locis signatis in sinistrâ columna, eamqꝫue adb inferioribus ad superiora dextrorsūum gyrare facio donec alium similiter vel fortè plura e reliquis signatis locis coeperit attingere, videoqꝫue loca sic attacta esse x3, x⁢x⁢y⁢y et y6. E terminis itaqꝫue y6−7⁢a⁢a⁢x⁢x⁢y⁢y+6⁢a3⁢x3 tanquam nihilo æqualibus (et insuper si placet reductis ad v6−7⁢v⁢v+6=0 ponendo y=v⁢a⁢x) quæro valorem y et invenio quadruplicem +a⁢x, −a⁢x, +2⁢a⁢x, ā −2⁢a⁢x, quorūum quemlibet pro primo termino Quotientis accipere licet prout e radicibus quampiam extrahere decretūum est. Sic æquatio y3+a⁢x⁢y+a⁢a⁢y−x3−2⁢a3=0, quam resolvebam in priori epistola dat −2⁢a3+a⁢a⁢y+y3=0 et inde y=a proximè. Cum itaqꝫue a sit primus terminus valoris y, pono p pro cæteris omnibus in infinitūum, et substituo a+p pro y. Obvenient hic aliquando difficultates nonnullæ, sed ex ijs credo D. Leibnitius se proprio Marte extricabit. Subsequentes vero termini q.r.s, &c eodem modo ex æquationibus secundis, tertiis cæterisqꝫue eruuntur quo primus p e prima; sed cura leviori, quia cæteri termini valoris y solent prodire dividendo terminūum involvente infimam potestatem indefinitæ quantitatis x per coefficientem radicis p,q,r, aut s. Intellexti credo ex superioribus regressionem ab areis curvarūum ad lineas rectas fieri per hanc extractionem radicis affectæ. Sed duo alij sunt modi quibus idem perficio eorum unus affinis est computationibus quibus colligebam approximationes sub finem alterius Epistolæ, et intelligi potest per hoc exemplum.

Quemadmodum si posito r radio circuli, x sinu recto arcus z, et x+x36⁢r⁢r+ 3⁢x540⁢r4+&c longitudine arcus istius atque hanc seriem e sinu recto ad tangentem vellem transferre: quæro longitudinem tangentis r⁢xr⁢r−x⁢x et reduco in infinitam seriem x+x32⁢r⁢r+3⁢x58⁢r4+&c: Qua dicta t colligo potestates ejus t3=x3+3⁢x52⁢r⁢r+&c. t5=x5+&c.

Sed siquis in usus Trigonometricos me jussisset exhibere expressionem arcus per Tangentem, eam non hoc circuitu sed directa methodo quæsivissem. Per hoc genus computi colliguntur etiam Series ex duabus vel pluribus indefinitis quantitatibus constantes: et radices affectarum æquationūum magna ex parte extrahuntur, sed ad hunc posteriorem usum adhibeo potius methodūum in alterâ epistola descriptam tanquam generaliorem, &, (Regulis pro elisione superfluorūum terminorum habitis,) paulo magis expeditam.

Alterūum modum regrediendi ab areis ad lineas rectas celare statui. Ubi dixi omnia pene Problemata solubilia existere, volui de ijs præsertim intelligi circa quæ Mathematici se hactenus occuparunt vel saltem in quibus ratiocinia mathematica locum aliquem obtinerent obtinere possunt. Nam alia sanè adeo perplexis conditionibus implicata excogitare liceat ut non satis comprehendere valeamus, et multò minus tantarum computationūum onus sustinere quod ista requirerent. Attamen ne nimium dixisse videor, inversa de Tangentibus Problemata sunt in potestate aliaqꝫue illis difficiliora ad quæ solvenda usus sum duplici methodo, unâ concinniori alterâ generaliori: utramqꝫue visum est impresentia literis transpositis consignare. ne propter alios idem obtinentes, institutum in aliquibus mutare cogerer. 5accd et 10effh11i4l3m9n6oqqr8s11t9v3x: 11ab3cdd10e et g10ill4m7n6o3p3q6rss11t8vx, 3ac et 4egh5i4l4m5n8oq4r35614vaadd et eeeeeiijmmnnooprrrsssssttuu. Inversum hoc Problema de tangentibus quando tangens inter punctūum contactus est et axem figuræ est datæ longitudinis, non indiget his methodis. Est tamen curva illa mechanica, cujus determinatio pendet ab area Hyperbola. Ejusdem generis est etiam Problema quando pars axis inter tangentem et dordinatim applicatam datur longitudine. Sed hos casus vix numeraverim inter9 inter ludos naturæ. Nam si in triangulo rectangulo quod ab illa axis parte, et tangente ordinatim applicata constituitur, relatio duorūum quorumlibet laterum per æquationem quamlibet definitur, Problema solvi potest absqꝫue mea methodo generali sed ubi pars axis ad punctūum aliquod positione datūum terminata ingreditur vinculūum tunc res aliter se habere solet. Communicatio Resolutionis affectarūum æquationum per methodum Leibnitij pergrata erit, juxta et explicatio quomodo se gerat ubi indices potestatum sunt fractiones ut in hac æquatione 20+x37−x65⁢y23−y711=0 20+x37, aut surdæ quantitates ut in hac x2+x7|‾③23=y x2+x7|‾③23=y, ubi 2 et 7 non designant coefficientes ipsius x sed indices potestatūum seu dignitatum ejus et ③23 indicem dignitatis binomij x2+x7.

Two dayes since I sent you an answere to Mr. Leibnitius excellent letter after it was gone running my eyes over a transcript that I had made to be taken of it I found some things which I could wish altered and I since I cannot now do it my self I desire you would doe it for me (those things are amended in this transcript.) I feare I have been something too severe in taking notice of some oversights in Mr. Leibnitius letter considering the goodness and ingenuity of the Author and that it might have beene my owne fate in writing hastily to have committed the like oversights, but yet they being I think real oversights I suppose he cannot be offended at it if you think any thing be expressed too severely pray give me notice of it and I will endeavour to mollify it unless you will doe for with a word or two of your owne I beleive Mr. Leibnitius will not dislike the Theoreme towards the beginning of my letter (pag 5) for squaring curve lines Geometrically Sometime when I have more leisure itiit is possible I may send him a fuller account of it explaining how it is to be ordered for comparing curvilinear lines figures with one another and how the simplest figure is to be found with which a compounded curve may be compared Some other things in Mr. Leibnitius letter I once thought to have tougcht you upon as the resolution of affected æquations and the impossibility of a geometricall Quadrature of the circle in which Mr Gregory seemes to have tripped but I shall add one thing here that the series of æquations for the section of any angle by whole numbers which Mr. TscurnhansTschurnhaus saith he can derive by any easy methode one from an other is conteined in that one æquation which I put in the third section of the problems in my former letter for cutting an angle in a given ratio and in another æquation like that also the coefficients of those æquations may be all obteined by this progression 1×n−0‾×n−1‾1×n−1‾×n−2‾×n−3‾2×n−2‾×n−4‾×n−5‾3×n−3‾×n−6‾×n−7‾4×n−4‾×&c The first coefficient being 1 the second 1×n−0‾×n−1‾1×n−1‾, the third 1×n−0‾×n−1‾1×n−1‾×n−2‾×n−3‾2×n−2‾ &c and n being the number by which the Angle is to be cut. As if n be 5 then the series is 1×5×4 1×4×1×03×2 that is 1×5×1×0, and consequently the coefficients 1.5.5 So if n be 6 the series is 1×6×51×5×4×32×4×2×13×3×0 that is 1×6×32×29×0 & consequently the coefficients 1.6.9.2. this Scribble is not fit to be seene by any body nor scarce my other letter in that blotted form I sent it unless it be by a freind",NATP00197,1676-10-26 00:00:00
245,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Letter from Newton to John Collins, dated 8 November 1676",MS Add. 9597/2/18/58-59,8 November 1676,England,['Latin'],"58 Sir I doubt you think I have forgot to answer your last letter, & to return you thanks for the pains you took in copying out for me the large letters of those two ingenious persons M. Leibnitz & M. Tschurnhause. As for what you propound about the former's calculation, you have well corrected 8⁢r53r⁢r+z⁢z‾ by turning it to 8⁢r5⁢z⁢z⁢β3r⁢r+z⁢z‾ where it signifies an area, but the ordinate NP is rightly 8⁢r53r⁢r+z⁢z‾, it being produced by dividing the rectangle 1P1N1N2P3 viz 8⁢r5⁢z⁢z⁢β3r⁢r+z⁢z‾ by its' base β. You seem to desire that I would publish my method & I look upon your advice as an act of singular friendship, being I beleive censured by divers for my scattered letters in the Transactions about such things as no body els would have let come out without a substantial discours. I could wish I had could retract what has been done, but by that, I have learnt what's to my convenience, which is to let what I write ly by till I am out of the way. As for the apprehension that M. Leibnitz's method may be more general or more easy then mine, you will not find any such thing. His observation about reducing all roots to fractions is a very ingenious one, & certainly his way of extracting affected roots is beyond it: but in order to series they seem to me laborious enough in comparison of the ways I follow, though for other ends they may be of excellent use, As for the method of Transmutations in general, I presume he has made further improvements then others have done, but I dare say all that can be done by it may be done better without it, by the simple consideration of the ordinatim applicatæ: not excepting the method of reducing roots to fractions. The advantage of the way I follow you may guess by the conclusions drawn frōom it which I have set down in my answer to M. Leibnitz: though I have not said all there. For there is no curve line exprest by any æquation of three terms, though the unknown quantities affect one another in it, or the indices of their dignities be fractions or surd quantities (suppose x+ a⁢xλ+b⁢xμ⁢yσ+c⁢yτ=0, where x signifies the base, y the ordinate , λ, μ, σ, τ, the indices of the dignities of x & y, & a, b, c known quantities with their signes + or −) I say there is no such curve line but I can in less then half a quarter of an hower tell whether it may be squared or what are the simplest figures it may be compared with, be those figures Conic sections or others. And then by a direct & short way (I dare say the shortest the nature of the thing admits of for a general one) I can compare them. And so if any two figures exprest by such æquations be propounded I can by the same rule compare them if they may be compared. This may seem a bold assertion because its' hard to 59 say a figure mayor may not be squared or compared with another, but it's plain to me by the fountain I draw it from, though I will not undertake to prove it to others. The same method extends to æquations of four terms & others also but not so generally. But I shall say no more at present but that I am Yours to serve you Is. Newton Cambridge. Novemb. 8. 1676.

166,Isaac Newton,Science,,"MS Add. 3976, ff. 38r-39v",28 November 1676,England,['English'],"Sir Sir I esteem my self much obliged to Mr Lucas for his case in making the Experimentum Crucis: but his reasoning I still forbear to meddle with becaus I will not run into any other dispute till I see a full end of what relates to Mr Linus. For if this running from one thing to another be allowed we shall never come to a conclusion in any thing. Mr Lucas would represent the question about the length of the Image improper if not preposterous to spend time on till the different refrangibility of rays differently coloured be agreeed on. That is he would wholly decline it. For by his asserting demonstrations against me it's plain he thinks the different refrangibility will never be agreed on. But however he represents it others may thinks it more preposterous to run from one thing to another before we come to a conclusion & esteem the question as materiall now as when twas Started & thought worthy of being put upon Mr Linus's account. The examining my Theory is but a new attempted digression. 'Tis the truth of my experiments which is the business in hand. On this my Theory depends, & which is of more consequence, the credit of my being wary, accurate and faithfull in the reports I have made or shall make of experiments in any subject, seeing that a trip in any one will bring all the rest into suspicion. And besides the full truth of what I have said in my first letter of colours about the impossibility of promoting much further Catadioptrical Telescopes depends on the length of the Image, and is of great moment, be the Theory true or or false Wherefore though I was willing to let pass any way of concluding Mr Linus's proper objection; presuming that he would have concluded it himself as much to his own honour as to my satisfaction had he lived to see the expert duely tryed: yet I cannot admit to have the remainder of the business wholly jostled out by a new Subject. Let what relates to Mr Linus be made an end of & then Mr Lucas may begin upon his own scoare as soon as he pleases. And becaus I hope his next letter will grant me what remains of the contended expert, that there be no further delays, I desire him to send me word which of his experiments he would have me begin with. For though whilst he urged his experiments but as exceptions which he hoped would not be unwelcome, I esteemed esteemed them not so proper to be considered in competition with a Demonstration, yet now he adds weight to their number presenting them for Demonstrations, & one Demonstration deservesesdeserves to be considered as well as another: I intend to take into consideration one or two of them which he shall recommend for the best: & when there appears to be no weight in those let others judge what there may be in the numbers of the rest. But I shall consider but one at a time, that neither of us may have room to run up and down in till we are agreed. You know how weary I have profest myself of this subject even before Mr Linus's first letter came to me; & as much might be gathered by my deferring to meddle with that business for a year together till I was urged to it, & also by some expressions in my last letter. And therefore I hope Mr Lucas will not press me beyond one, or two of his objections though afterwards I may say something more of that the rest. But becaus we stick at the Question about the length of the Image, to prevent unnecessary demurrs I cannot but say something more of that. Mr Lucas tells you when convenience of weather, and Prismes shall serve he shall be glad to see how farr the length of the Spectrūum made by Prismes of different angle. sett down in my last letter will agree with observations at Liege: but yet that he thinks it improper to spend time on that precise length of the Spectrūum by severall Prisms before the different refrangibility of rays be agreed on. That is he still turns off the Quæstion in hand to a new one, as if the business now was onely to examin my last lLetter. The length made by several angles I sent not to create new unnecessary disputes but onely to accommodate my oObservations to the Prisms of men abroad to try and judge between us, and therefore though Mr Lucas may try them also for his private satisfaction, yet I think it as improper as he does to spend time on preciseness of all those The Question in hand is this. TWhether the Image in the eExperiment set down set down in my first letter about colours printed in the Transactions Num 80 could be five times longer than broad as I have there exprest it, or but three or at most three and a half as Mr Lucas has [39] has represented it. To this I desire a direct answer: which I hope will be so free as (without putting me to any further wayies of justifying myself) may take off all suspicion of my misrepresenting matter of fact. If Mr Lucas hath not yet procured a Prism with an angle about the bigness of mine there used, & with sides not at all concave, but plain or onely a very little convex, let him onely upon the receipt of this signify without any insinuation of suspicion that he sees no reason to oppose or question me further upon the experiments they have hitherto made and proceeded on, & I shall acquiesce and begin with his oObjections; & this I think he need not stick at seeing he is now to seek for a due Prism to try the Experiment with, & in his former letter where he started the Question he set down the angle of his Prism less than that in my experiment he wrote against: not attending to this pPrinciple that the greater angle makes the greater length of the Image. Yet I cannot but say that I had rather have my experiment confirm'd by his assent than the suspicion only taken of. But yet I leave it to him to conclude the buisiness any way, so it be but concluded before any thing els be urged upon me. So I am Your humble Servant Is. Newton Is. Newton. In the last clause of Mr Lucas's Letter where he says that I calculated the length of the Spectrum by divers Prisms: the word calculate misrepresentes what I sent him; the force of which lay in their being not calculated but measured. I desire Mr Lucas would be very exact in measuring the angle of the Prism he tries the Experiment with: for I must confess I cannot but suspect that the angle he Set down before (I imagin by guess) for 60 degrees, was nearer to 50. I could wish we knew the just measure of that angle. If it be as I conjecture it would end the Question. The way to examin whether an angle be justly measured is to measure all the 3three angles of the Prism by the same method & see if their summ be 180 degrees. Cambridge. Nov. 28. 1676.

last yeare sent up these Letters*, * you have seen with particular leave upon my importunity to print the same, and I seeing you therein mentioned I imparted the first Letter to you (which I thinke if I had not I beleive you had not seen either to this day) In your narrative you say Mr Newton began to fall into these methods in 1669 or 1670, whereas in the larger Letter he tells you he seemed delighted hisce ventis namely in Calculating Logarithmes and Van Ceulens Numbers in his retirement from the University in the Plague yeare in 1665, and in 1666 he writt the treatise above mentioned, all the account you can give out of those Letters is but very slender in relation to his performances, he intends a full treatise of Algebra consisting of these Parts according to the best of my apps 1 for the an Introductory part he bought a translation of from Kinckhuysen Introduction out of low Dutch turned by Mercator into Latin, r which he bought and is so excellent, that it comprehends many of Huddens reductions, and those mentioned by Dary at the end of his tract of Interest & some others to which he Mr Newton added diverse things much of his owne 2 A Collection of diverse Excellent A Problems discourse about bringing Problemes to an Æquation with a Collection of diverse notable ones 3 A Treatise about the Construction of Problemes and Æquations which I have seen, all Solid Problems are by viz those of 4 and 3 Dimensions are solved by ayd of one Constant Circle (if so desired) supposed to be intersected by Conick Sections, the description whereof is avoyded by helpe of mooveable angles that give the severall Points of Intersection sought, other Equations betweene the 5 and 9 degree inclusive he performes by ayd of a Cubicall Parabola that being once described in like manner remaines constant, and is to be intersected by a Conick Section as before the description whereof is avoyded as before &c he hath With also diverse tentative Constructions for Cubicks and Biquads from Plaine Geometry 4 A Discourse concerning the severall kinds of infinite Series considering which kinds more fitt are most convincing and fitt for Calculation, and which for Construction and Demonstration, of this Argument he hath and of the whole buisinesse of Series he hath written a new and large treatise since that above mentioned, and hath performed aboundantly more than is either mentioned or can be guessed from the Letters above mentioned 5 A Treatise de Locis 6 The same applyed to Dioptriques concerning the worth of both which Dr Barrow affirmed he was so farr su was not only surprized but others would thinke it incredible Scotus owes debt to Aristotle, yet doth him plainer make Therefore should he in Scots debt be, if there is no mistake 2 Mr Gregory having but one of Mr Newtons Series's sent him namely that for the Zone of a Circle after some study fell into the method, and began to be prurient about publishing something concerning it, as being offended I did not publish his Solution of Keplars Probleme, which I would not doe as knowing Mr Newton's Series's were made use of therein and yet he had a good right so to doe for he really advanced the Doctrine, namely after a few tearmes of a Series were attained he had approaches for attaining the Sum of a great many more, moreover he could give a fractionate part of some pure but high Power of the root of a Series equall to the Sum of as many tearmes therein as were desired These Series of Mr Newton did not hinder Mr Gregory from prosecuting his owne Converging Series, as more proper for Construction though worse for Calculation, by and ass who when he was last here that much after the Same manner as he had streightned an Arch of a Circle which I formerly accquainted you with he could streighten most other Curves, and particularly had streightened the Ellipticall Parabolic all and Hyperbolicall Lines which Dr Pell saith he can doe by a Canon of Sines & Tangents, the which indeed will remoove the use but not the necessity of Series from whence to derive such Canons and this being attained addes a topstone to this most excellent doctrine. After Mercator had published his Logarithmotechnia you mend his Series in the Transactions adde a Series better than his which you now claime, What sayes Gregory to this, namely that he emptyed both Mercators and your Series of each other tearme, and what Mercator, namely in an Appendix now at the Presse, namely he shewes by his owne methods without rejecting these advantages he shewes how to make a whole Canon of Logarithmes by Addition, you may therefore omitt such claime, without any Dispendium of renowne Sir In sum if you thinke not fitt the tendency of what you have writt, is to show the world that Mr Newton's Series were derived from yours this he graunts, and tis better to sayth so himselfe he attained these methods his Seriess by 3 Methods concerning the first he ha as I remember for I have not as yet a Coppy of the larger letter attained it was by interpoling yours where your selfe gave over, and afterwards he forsooke this method and having m at falne into two method ones of his owne To Dr Wallis",NATP00189,1677-01-01 00:00:00

Sir, Next to my hearty wishes of many happy new years to you, I am to acquaint you, vpon the receipt of yours of Dec. 26, that Mr Austen is dead, without leaving any child; so that I know not at present, who may supply his place, but shall inquire of my friend, how to proceed in this matter, and giue you notice accordingly. I am of thesame opinion with you that tis better to suspend that printing of the two letters mention'd in your last, till you haue answer'd some at least of the Objections made from Liege. I cannot but acquaint you with an extraordinarily curious present, sent to me from beyond seas for the King as Founder of the R. Society and for the society itself which I presented yesterday to his Majesty as philosophical strena, and shall present to the Society on thursday next, God willing, where I wish you present, especially since it is, so uncommon a Phænomenon of Light. For it is a Factitious stony matter (not at all of the lapsi Bononiensis) which, being for a litle while exposed to the Day, or the flame of a Candle, so imbibes the light as to shine in the dark, like a glowing Coal, and continues that splendor a longer or shorter time according to that duration, it hath been kept turned to the day — or candle — light. The king and whole Court were exceedingly pleased with this phænomenon: And And I should be yet more, if I might know to giue a reasonable rational account of thesame, and with what kind of Theory concerning Light it agrees best. Supposing, you would be well pleased, with us, to hear of such an unusual effect, I would not omit imparting it to you, as Sir your faithfull humble servant H.

Example Latitude 52: the Declination 20⁢degs North I demand the Azimuth at :10 in the morning & :2: in the Affter noon: & at :6: in the morning & 6 past noone at 2. in the morning & 10 at night at theese six hours I demand the Sun or Stars Azimuth: Aganst the Latitude 52 under the hour 102 I finde the sum of ye Roote of yt hour to be —12313: then the declination being 20⁢degs=00⁢′ the Tangent thereof is — 3640 :by wch Tangent I multiply ye Roote by thus — 03640_4925207387800036939000_Rest.4481/9320 the Equinoctall tangt for yt hour & Lat' is —13648_ the produce of ye Roote of Azimuth is nearest —4482_ by Substract facit —9166_ by Adition facit —18130_ ye 12 of ye produce facit —2241_ Three sums Heare I finded by Addition: Substraction & 12 the produce 12 which sums sheweth the = sheweth the Tangent of 6 Hours Azimuth Thus. First I finde by Substracting 4482: out of the the Equinoctiall Tangent 13648 Rest 9166: which sum is the Tangent of 42⁢degs=31·⁢m for the Azimuth of .10: morning & .2: past noon. Secondly I finde by Adding of — 4482 To — 13648: facit 18130: which Sum is the Tangent of 61⁢degs=07⁢min: for the Azimuth at 2 in the morning & at 10 at night. Lastly the halfe of — 4482 is — 2241: which Sum is the Tangent of 12⁢degs=38⁢min: for the Azimuth at 6 in the morning & 6: past noone. Thus by this Rule you finde 6 Hours Azimuth pp the produce of one small multiplication: shewd by Addition Substraction & 12 the Summm. Againe I demand the Azimuth for theese 4 Hours of the day or night vizd for the Hour of 9 in the morning or 3 past noone, 9 at nigh or 3 in morning The declination 20⁢degs, Latitude 52⁢d=00´: the Roote of these hours Azimuth is —8706the Equinoct_ Tangt for yt hour & Lat' is —7880being Multiplyed by the Tangent of 20⁢degs of declination wch is —003640_— facit nearest 3169. . . . .3169_348240facit by Substract_04711_5223600facit by Addition1104926118000_Rest3168/9840 Heare I finde by substracting 3169 out of 7880: Rest 4711 : which is the Tangent of 25⁢degs=13⁢min: which is the Azimuth for 9 in the morning or 3 past noon. But if I Add 3169 to — 7880: facit 11049 which sum is the Tangent of 47⁢degs=51⁢min which is the Azimuth at 3 in the morning or 9 at night for North declination. But the Contrary hours for South declination: thus you may doe for any of that; said Latitudes to any Hour & declination. To finde the Tangent of the Equinoctiall Hours Azimuth is Thus: Multiplye the Tangent of the Hours distance from :6: by the Sine of the Latitude Cut of 4 figures & the Remaner is the Tangent of the Azimuth: the Radius being 10000: To finde the Roote of Azimuth: or Tangent of 45⁢degs of declination: Multiply the Cosine of the Latitude being doubled by the Secant of the hour Being counted from :6: Cutt of 4 figures to the Right hand from the product; then halfe the Remaner shall be the desired Summm for the Roote of the Hours Azimuth: Now if you Add or Substract this Root of the Hours Azimuth To the Tangent of the saide Equinoctiall Hours Azimuth it will shew the Tangent of the hours Azimuth for 45⁢degs of Declination: Heare I have shewded the proportions by which I Calculated the Sun' & The North Star's Hourly Azimuth which I would have done when I sent Mr Newton my Last Table of the Sun's Hourly Azimuth which I could not then doe by Reason of the shortness of my Time: Therefore I would Intreat your favour if that you pleace dTo do me that kindness once moore as to lett desire him to Looke over theese proportions To see whether they hold Good yea or not for I have bestoooed so much paines with them. In the Same Manner as I have shewed you by the Tables Heare made universall: Tables for All Latitudes vizd from the Equinoctiall to the Pole. Therefore if Mr Newton could doe me that faivour as to Resolve me of which in 6 or 8 dayes affter the dait of this He would much Oblidge me thereby: Haveing no moore at present But Returning you many thancks for your Trouble & Great G kindeness at Boothby & Elcewhear with my True Love & Service To Mr Newton Returning him many thancks for his kindeness I Rest at your Command your Nepheu to Seve you Arthur Storer London September 19th: 1678 Thanckes be to God All with us heare ar very well: hopeing the like with you.

248,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Letter from Newton to Robert Boyle, dated 28 February 1678/9",MS Add. 9597/2/18/62-65,28 February 1678/9,England,"['English', 'Latin']","62(1) Honoured Sir I have so long deferred to send you my thoughts about the Physicall qualities we spake of, that did I not esteem my self obliged by promise I think I should be ashamed to send them at all. The truth is my notions about things of this kind are so indigested that I am not well satisfied my self in them, & what I am not satisfied in I can scarce esteem fit to be communicated to others, especially in natural Philosophy where there is no end of fansying. But because I am indebted to you & yesterday met with a friend Mr Maulyverer, who told me he was going to London & intended to give you the trouble of a visit, I could not forbear to take the opportunity of conveying this to you by him. It being only an explication of qualities which you desire of me, I shall set down my apprehensions in the form of suppositions as follows. And first I suppose that there is diffused through all places an æthereal substance capable of contraction & dilatation, strongly elastick, & in a word much like air in all respects, but far more subtile. 2 I suppose this æther pervades all gross bodies, but yet so as to stand rarer in their pores then in free spaces, & so much the rarer as their pores are less. And this I suppose (with others) to be the cause why light incident on those bodies is refracted towards the perpendicular; why two well polished metalls cohere in a Receiver exhausted of air: why Quicksilver stands sometimes up to the top of a glass pipe though much higher than 30 inches: & one of the main causes why the parts of all bodies cohere. Also the cause of philtration & of the rising of water in small glass pipes above the surface of the stagnating water they are dipt into: for I suspect the æther may stand rarer not only in the insensible pores of bodies, but even in the very sensible cavities of those pipes. And the same principle may cause Menstruums to pervade with violence the pores of the bodies they dissolve, the surrounding æther as well as the Atmosphere pressing them together. 3 I suppose the rarer æther within bodies & the denser without them, not to be terminated in a mathematical superficies but to grow gradually into one another: the external æther beginning to grow rarer, & the internal to grow denser at some little distance from the body superficies of the body, & running through all intermediate degrees of density in the intermediate spaces. And this may be the cause why light in Grimaldo's experiment passing by the edge of a knife or other opake body is turned aside & as it were refracted, & by that refraction makes several colours. Let ABCD be a dense body whether opake or transparent, EFGH the outside of the uniform æther which is within it, IKLM the inside of the uniform æther which is without it; & conceive the æther which is between EFGH and IKLM to run through all intermediate degrees of density between that of the two uniform æthers on either side. This being supposed, the rays of the sun SB, SK, which pass by the edge of this body between B & K, ought in their passage through the unequally dense æther there, to receive a ply from the denser æther which is on that side towards K, & that the more by how much they pass nearer to the body, & thereby to be scattered through the space PQRST, as by experience they are found to be. Now the space between the limits EFGH & IKLM I shall call the space of the æther's graduated rarity. 4 When two bodies moving towards one another come neare together I suppose the æther between them to grow rarer then before, & the spaces of its graduated rarity to extend further from the superficies of the bodyies towards one another, & this by reason that the æther cannot move & play up & down so freely in the strait passage between the bodies as it could before they came so neare together. Thus if the space of the æther's graduated rarity reach from the body ABCDFE only to the distance GHLMRS when no other body is neare it, yet may it reach farther, as to IK, when another body NOPQ approchaches: & as the other body approaches more & more I suppose the æther between them will grow rarer & rarer. These suppositions I have so described as if I thought the spaces of graduated æther had precise limits, as is exprest at IKLM in the first figure & GMRS in the second: for thus I thought I could better express my self. But really I do not think they have such precise limits but rather decay insensibly, & in so decaying extend to a much greater distance then can easily be beleived or need be supposed. 5 Now from the 4th supposition it follows that when two bodies approaching one another, come so neare together as to make the æther between them begin to rarefy, they will begin to have a reluctance from being brought nearer together, & an endeavour to recede from one another: which reluctance & endeavour will encrease as they come nearer together because thereby they cause the interjacent æther to rarefy more & more. But at length, when they come so neare together that the excess of pressure of the external æther which surrounds the bodies, above that of the rarefied æther which is between them, is so great as to overcome the reluctance which the bodies have from being brought together: then will that excess of pressure drive them with violence together & make them adhere strongly to one another, as was said in the second supposition. For instance in the second Figure when the bodies ED & NP are so neare together, that the spaces of the æthers graduated rarity begin to reach to one another & meet in the line IK; the æther between them will have suffered much rarefaction which rarefaction requires much force that is much pressing of the bodies together: & the endeavour which the æther between them has to return to its former state natural state of condensation will cause the bodies to have an endeavour of receding from one another. But on the other hand to counterpoise this endeavour there will not yet be any excess of density of the æther which surrounds the bodies above that of the æther which is between them at the line IK. But if the bodies come nearer together so as to 63 to make the æther in the mid-way-line IK grow rarer then the surrounding æther, there will arise from the excess of density of the surrounding æther a compressure of the bodies towards one another: which when by the nearer approach of the bodies it becomes so great as to overcome the afforesaid endeavour the bodies have to recede from one another, they will then go towards one another & adhere together. And on the contrary if any power force them as under to that distance where the endeavour to recede begins to overcome the endeavour to accede, they will again leap from one another. Now hence I conceive it is chiefly that a fly walks on water without wetting her feet, & consequently without touching the water; that two polished pieces of glass are not without pressure brought to contact, no not though the one be plain, the other a little convex; that the particles of dust cannot by pressing be made to cohere, as they would do if they did but fully touch; that the particles of tinging substances & salts dissolved in water do not of their own accord concrete & fall to the bottom, but diffuse themselves all over the liquor, & expand still more if you ad more liquor to them. Also that the particles of vapors exhalations & air do stand at a distance from one another, & endeavour to recede as far from one another as the pressure of the incumbent atmosphere will let them: for I conceive the confused mass of vapors air & exhalations which we call the Atmosphere to be nothing els but the particles of all sorts of bodies of which the earth consists, separated from one another & kept at a distance by the said principle. From these principles the actions of Menstruums upon bodies may be thus explained. Suppose any tinging body as Cochineel or Logwood be put into water, so soon as the water sinks into its pores & wets on all sides any particle, which adheres to the body only by the principle in second supposition: it takes of or at least much diminishes the efficacy of that principle to hold the particle to the body because it makes the æther on all sides the particle to be of a more uniform density then before. And then the particle being shaken of by any little motion, flotes in the water, & with many such others makes a tincture; which tincture will be of some lively colour if the particles be all of the same size & density, otherwise of a dirty one. For the colours of all natural bodies whatever seem to depend on nothing but the various sizes & densities of their particles: as I think you have seen described by me more at large in another paper. If the particles be very small (as are those of salts Vitriols & gumms) they are transparent, & as they are supposed bigger & bigger they put on these colours in order black, white, yellow, red; violet, blew, pale green, yellow, orange, red; purple, blew, green, yellow, orange, red &c: as is discerned by the colours which appear at the several thicknesses of very thin plates of transparent bodies. Whence to know the causes of the changes of colours which are often made by the mixtures of several liquors, it is to be considered how the particles of any tincture may have their size or density altered by the infusion of another liquor. When any metal is put into common water, the water cannot enter into its pores to act on it & dissolve it. Not that water consists of too gross parts for this purpose, but because it is unsociable to metal. For there is a certain secret principle in nature by which liquors are sociable to some things & unsociable to others. Thus water will not mix with oyle but readily with spirit of wine or with salts. It sinks also into wood which Quicksilver will not, but Quicksilvers sinks into metals, which, as I said, water will not. So Aqua fortis dissolves silver not gold; Aqua regis gold & not silver, &c. But a liquor which is of it self unsociable to a body may by the mixture of a convenient mediator be made sociable. So molten Lead which alone will not mix with copper or with Regulus of Mars, by the addition of Tin is made to mix with either. And water by the addition of mediation of saline spirits will mix with metal. Now when any metal is put in water impregnated with such spirits, as into Aqua fortis, Aqua Regis, spirit of Vitriol or the like, the particles of the spirits as they in floting in the water, strike on the metal, will by their sociableness enter into its pores & gather round its outside particles, & by advantage of the continual tremor the particles of the metal are in, hitch themselves in by degrees between those particles & the body & loosen them from it, & the water entring into the pores together with the saline spirits, the particles of the metal will be thereby still more loosed, so as by that motion the solution puts them into, to be easily shaken of & made to Rote in the water: the saline still particles still encompassing the metallick ones as a coat or shell does a kernell, after the manner expressed in the annexed figure. In which figure I have made the particles round, though they may be cubical or of any other shape. If into a solution of metal thus made, be poured a liquor abounding with particles, suppose of salt to which the former saline particles are more sociable then to the particles of the metal, (suppose with particles of salt of Tartar:) then so soon as they strike on one another in the liquor, the saline particles will adhere to those more firmly then to the metalline ones, & by degrees be wrought of from those to enclose these. Suppose A a metalline particle enclosed with saline ones of spirit of Nitre, & E a particle of salt of Tartar contiguous to two of the particles of spirit of nitre b & c, & suppose the particle E is impelled by any motion towards d so as to roll about the particle c till it touch the particle d: the particle b adhering more firmly to E then to A, will be forced off from A. And by the same means the particle E as it rolls about A will tear of the rest of the saline particles from A, one after another, till it has got them all or almost all about it self. And when the metallic particles are thus divested of the nitrous ones which as a mediator between them & the water held them floting in it: the Alcalizate ones crouding for the room the metallic ones took up before, will press these towards one another & make them come more easily together: so that by the motion they continually have in the water they shall be made to strike on one another, & then by means of the principle in the second supposition they will cohere & grow into clusters, & fall down by their weight to the bottom, which is called precipitation. In the solution of metals, when a particle is loosing from the body, so soon as it gets to that distance from it where the principle of receding described in the 4th & 5t suppositions begins to overcome the principle of acceding described in the second conclusion supposition: the receding of the particle will be thereby accelerated, so that the particle shall as were with violence leap from the body, & putting the liquor into a brisk agitation, beget & promote that heat we often find to be caused in solutions of Metals. And if any particle happen to leap of thus from the body before it be surrounded with water, or to leap of with that smartness as to get loos from the water: the water by the principle in the 4th & 5t suppositions, will be kept of from the particle & stand round about it like a spherically hollow arch, not being able to come to a full contact with it any more. And severall of these particles afterwards gathering into 64(2) into a cluster, so as by the same principle to stand at a distance from one another without any water between them, will compose a buble. Whence I suppose it is that in brisk solutions there usually happens an ebullition. This is one way of transmuting gross compact substances into aereal ones. Another way is by heat. For as fast as the motion of heat can shake off the particles of water from the surface of it: those particles by the said principle will Rote up & down in the air at a distance both from one another & from the particles of air, & make that substance we call vapor. Thus I suppose it is when the particles of a body are very small (as I suppose those of water are) so that the action of heat alone may be sufficient to shake them asunder. But if the particles be much larger, they then require the greater force of dissolving Menstruums to separate them, unless by any means the particles can be first broken into smaller ones. For the most fixed bodies, even Gold it self, some have said will become volatile only by breaking their parts smaller. Thus may the volatility & fixedness of bodies depend on the diffetrent sizes of their parts. And on the same difference of size may depend the more or less permanency of aereal substances in their state of rarefaction. To understand this let us suppose ABCD to be a large piece of any metal, EFGH the limit of the interior uniform æther, & K a part of the metal neare at the edge superficies of the metal AB. If this part or particle K be so little that it reaches not to the limit EF, its plain that the æther at its center must be less rare then if the particle were greater, for were it greater, its center would be further from the superficies AB, that is, in a place where the æther (by supposition) is rarer. The less the particle K therefore, the denser the æther at its center, because its center comes nearer to the edge AB where the æther is denser then within the limit EFGH. And if the particle were divided from the body & removed to a distance from it where the æther is still denser, the æther within it must proportionally grow denser. If you consider this you may apprehend how by diminishing the particle, the rarity of the æther within it will be diminished, till between the density of the æther without & the density of the æther within it there be little difference, that is till the cause be almost taken away which should keep this & other such particles at a distance from one another. For that cause, explained in the 4th & 5t suppositions, was the excess of of density of the external æther above that of the internal. This may be the reason then why the small particles of vapors easily come together & are reduced back into water unless the heat which keeps them in agitation be so great as to dissipate them as faster their as they come together: but the grosser particles of exhalations raised by fermentation keep their aerial form more obstinately, because the æther within them is rarer. Nor does the size only but the density of the particles also conduce to to the permanency of aereal substances. For the excess of density of the æther without such particles above that of the æther within them is still greater. Which has made me sometimes think that the true permanent Air may be of a metallic metallic original: the particles of no substances being more dense then those of metals. This I think is also favoured by experience for I remember I once read in the Philosophical Transactions how M. Hugens at Paris found that the air made by dissolving salt of Tartar would in two or three days dtime condense & fall down again, but the air made by dissolving a metal continued permanent without condensing or relenting in the least. If you consider then how by the continual fermentations made in the bowels of the earth there are aereal substances raised out of all kinds of bodies, all which together make the Atmosphere & that of all these the metallic are the most permanent, you will not perhaps think it absurd that the most permanent part of the Atmosphere, which is the true air, should be constituted of these: especially since they are the heaviest of all other & so must subside to the lower parts of the Atmosphere & float upon the surface of the earth, & buoy up the lighter exhalation & vapours to float in greatest plenty above them. Thus I say it ought to be with the metallic exhalations raised in the bowels of the earth by the action of acid menstruums, & thus it is with the true permanent air. For this as in reason it ought to be esteemed the most ponderous part of the Atmosphere because the lowest: so it betrays its ponderosity by making vapors ascend readily in it, by susteining mists & clouds of snow, & by buoying up gross & ponderous smoke. The air also is the most gross unactive part of the Atmosphere affording living things no nourishment if deprived of the more tender exhalations & spirits that flote in it: & what more unactive & remote from nourishment then metallick bodies. I shal set down one conjecture more which came into my mind now as I was writing this letter. It is about the cause of gravity. For this end I will suppose æther to consist of parts differing from one another in subtilty by indefinite degrees: That in the pores of bodies there is less of the finer grosser æther in proportion to the finer then in open spaces, & consequently that in the great body of the earth there is much less of the grosser æther in proportion to the finer then in the regions of the air: & that yet the grosser æther in the Air affects the upper regions of the earth & the finer æther in the earth the lower regions of the air, in such a manner that from the top of the air to the surface of the earth & again from the surface of the earth to the center thereof the æther is insensibly finer & finer. Imagin now any body suspended in the air or lying on the earth: & the æther being by the Hypothesis grosser in the pores which are in the upper parts of the body then in those which are in its lower parts, & that grosser æther being less apt to be lg lodged in those pores then the finer æther below, it will endeavour to get out & give way to the finer æther below, which cannot be without the bodies descending to make room above for it to go out into. From this supposed gradual subtilty of the parts of æther some things above might be further illustrated & made more intelligible, but by what has been said you will easily discern whether in these conjectures there be any degree of probability, which is all I aim at 65 at. For my own part I have so little fansy to things of this nature that had not your encouragement moved me to it, I should never I think have thus far set pen to paper about them. What's amiss therefore I hope you will the more easily pardon in Your most humble Servant & honourer Is. Newton. Cambridge Feb 28. 16789 Philosophical Tract frōom Mr Isaac Newton. Cambridge.

I have heare incloased sent you a Coppey or Table of the Moation of a Comet that appeared with us Last falle in Maryland which as I suppoase did first appeare a morning star in the South East November 16: 1680 the 19th I did see it about 5 in the morning in neare conjunction with the virgins Spike the comet being Elivated above it about 34 of a degree: the 20th of November at 5 in the morning I beheld it & it was then about 2 degrees under Spica virginis being very swift in Motion declineing much to the southward being direct haveing south Latitude the 22 of November affter brake of the day I did see it neare the South East which seemed to me as though it would come to the meridian with Arcturus affter which day we haveing about a weke of clowdey mornings the comet being direct & swift in motion drew so neare the Sun that that it was not seene no more with us till I suppoase till as I suppoase it became an Evening star which was first sene then to appeare with us it was december the 16th that the Comet appeared: but part of the Taile or Streame thereof It being so Large & bright was seene about the 10th day affter Sun Sett in the South west which was a very great amaizement to many & likewise to my selfe to see such a Long bright streame then In forme like a Sword Streameing from the Horizon about 30⁢degs in altitude being so nearly affter Sun Set & no star to be Seene with us Till the 16 day which was the first time that Observations could be made as is heare shewed by this Encloased table. Though I have sett downe theare Every dayes Motion from the 16th of december to the 13th of January yet my dayes of Observation was as followeth Impr December 16 & 17: the 25th the 26: the 28 the 30th: January the :1: the 2: the 7 & 8: the 11 & 13 the the 25th & 26: the 30 & 31: after which time the Comet was so Obscuredd that Observation could not be well maid though part of the taile appeared till about the 5th of february: about which time it Spent it Selfe to Southward of the Head of Meduza: But what neede I trouble you with a Table there of So rudely cumpoased for no doubt but you ar furnished Long before this with tables thereof far more presise & exact then this is by Observations which hath bene allredey made with you by far more Large & Costley Instruments then mine be for I suppoase that the Comet did appeare To all Inhabitable parts of the world by Reason of the North & South declination it had though I suppoase that being a Eveing star it might in some placeis appeare sooner then in others. Therefore If you please to do me that kindeness as to Lett Mr Newton Looke over this Table To see how much I have Ered in my Observations & If he please to give me an Accompt thereof. As for the Instrument by which I Observed, it was but a pocket pece & therefore cannot be so Exact as those of far Larger Sizeses therefore mine may sometimes faile about one degree in the Right Ascension & 12 a degree in the declination which is in some placeis yes but one forth part of a dayes Motion. As for the Longitude of this place I suppoase it to be about 75⁢degs from London westwardly. But If Mr Newton be more desirous to know the Trueth thereof There was an Eclips of the Mone Feb 22: 168081_ the beginning with us was about 4⁢Hors=45⁢min in the Morning the Moone at Setting neare about 10 digits Eclipsed by which meanes the Longitude may somewhat nearly be Obtained by them who ar well versed in astronomy: Our Latitude being 38=30.

This Comet as I supppoase did first appeare a Morning Star & as far as I can give notice thereof was first seene with us to appeare In Maryland was November the :16: 1680: Being a Morning Star In the South west which I suppose then to be neare the 10th degre of Libra haveing then but Litle Latitude from the Ecliptick being as I suppoase Northward: of frijday the 19th about 5 in the Morning I did see it about South East in neare Conjunction with the virgines Spike the Comett being elivated above it about 34 of a degree at which time I beheld it with a prospective glass & seemed to me to be very bigg so that I could Judg it to be no Less then 2 or 3 times bigger then Spica virgneSpica virginis as I compared them by the glass which appeared of a grim pale Leadon Coller more Like a bright cloud then a star the Taile then being about 15⁢d or :20⁢d: in Length darting uppwards as the Evening Comet did the 20th day of November about 5 in the morning I beheld it & it was then about 2days under Spica virginis Being very swift in motion & direct the 22 day of November I did see it neare the S: East which seemed to me to Come as though it would come to the Meridian with Arcturus after which day was about a weke or better of clowdey wether with us I & the the & the comet being Direct & very swift in Motion drew so nareneare the Sunn that it was not seene no moore with us: till as I suppose it became an Evening Star which was first seene then to appeare with us was December 16th that the comet appeared but part of the taile or streame therof it being so Large & bright was seene about the 10th day of December after Sun Sett in the south west which was a very great amazement to many & Likewise to my selfe to see such a Long bright streame then in forme Like a sword streameing from the Horizon above 30⁢degs in altitude being so nearely after Sun Sett & no star then to be seene: the 16th day when first the Comet appeared I Observed the Leingth of the taile which was then about 55 or 60 Degrees in Length & Likewise the hight of the Taile when that the comett was about setting neare about 45 degrees so that I did observe that the Taile did appeare affter that the comett was sett about 3 or 4 hours it being so bright & Long that I suppoase that the Like hath not beene seene this 100: of yeares for to have so Large & bright a streame or taile though the Comett was but small not much neare so bigg to the Ey as the morning Comet Weare & the Reason is as I suppoase is because it was neare the Sun & had in a months Time above 14 spent it selfe for 5 or 6 months time is supposed to spend the Greatest comet as Ever yet was seene. I might have heare sett downe the Longitude & Latitude But by Reason of the Smallness of my Instruments by which I observed I might be subject apt to faile somewhat of Exactness thereby which may by Chance faile about one Degree in the Right Ascension & halfe a degree in the Declination. Therefore I Omitted the Longitude & Latitude & sett downe onely the Right Ascension Declination & time of Cullmination whereby is Easily gained the Longitude & Latitude & likewise the Comets Ryseing Southing & Setting Altitude Amplitude Azimuth the Cozmicall Rysing & Acronicall Setting for Every day from december :16th: to Jan 13 & the Rest According to the Table &c.",NATP00341,1681-04-18 00:00:00

If So it Seemed to me Somewhat Retrograde but I had but a small glimpes theareof & therefore could make no Observations thereof But I suppose that Observations might be maid Long after in Most placeis wheare the wether was cleare: I suppose I was one of the first that Tooke notice thereoff in Maryland Being August the 14th a morning Comet in the NorEast about 10⁢degs Northwards of the North heade of Gemini Castor But seemed To mee to come to the Meridian with the South head of Gemini Pollux, or somewhat after. It had than no Streame Cord or Taile at all that could be deserned Eather by the Eye or Elce by a prospective Glass as I could deserne neather would I trust my owne Eye in the cais but called upp others which I thought might be stronger sited To have there Judgement of it for I was Suer that no Such star did belong to that place nor To any Other that I was aquented with but they could not deserne any SteameStreame & would have perswaided me that it weare a commmon Ordinary Star but being so neare day & unprovided that I could make then but Litle Observations thereof onley I doe suppose that the declination then was Betwene 41⁢d: & :42⁢d North & Right Ascension about 112 degrees But whether afterwards it did Increase in declination Norwards as it seemed to me the 17th about 3⁢hors=30⁢min to be in neare conjunction with a Litle Star of the 3 or 4th Magnitude being To the Southwards of the 2 small Bear Stars in the Right forefoot of the Great Beare as I take it which Small star cometh partley to the Meridian Betwene both of them they Being 1 degreedeg As under declination 48`48⁢deg or 49`49⁢deg the Right Ascension about 130⁢degs declination of which Small Star about 43⁢degs North, the. conjunction as neare as I could make it onely by the Eye weare about 3⁢ho:=30⁢m morning the comet bingbeing about 30′ or 40′ min Southwards under it So by that Rule the Comets declination weare then about 42⁢d=15⁢m this was the nearest conjunction of any that I Observed & I give you Notice thereof because I suppose that the Comet may have greater paralax than ether Venus or Mercury It being than so swift in Motion as I suppose about 7⁢degs & sometimes neare 8 degrees in 24 hours.

Example the Buls Eye Aldebaran Anno 1700: Right Ascension 64`=44´ I looke nearest in the Table & finde Against the Right Ascension of 65d=:00m — 88d=44m Then Aldebarans declination being sup_osed to be —15=52_North I Substract it from 88=44 then Rest ye distance from N ✱ —72=52: Againe the Goat hircus Right Ascension 73`=28´: declination 45`=N40´ by proportion Betweene 70 & 75 I finde 89`=02´ from which I Substract the declination 45`=40´ Rest 43`=22´ from the Pole Star. Againe By the Bow or forestaff I Take Arcturus distance from the Pole Star & finde it to be 71`=18´. Then suppose Arcturus Right Ascention To be 210=40: I Looke in the Table Against 210degs=00´ & finde 92`=09´: but if I allow for the 40m: I shall find nerest 92=08 71=18_ from wch I Substract 71=18: then Rest ye declination20=50 Haveing once found the declination To finde the declination for any Time past or To Come. Example then suppose Arcturus declination Be Anor 1700: 20d=.50m the Right Ascension 210d=.40m I Looke as before against 210d=00m & finde 0d=.30m which is Arcturus difference of declination for 100 years. Then for the yeare l800: If I substract from Arcturus declination which is as before 20=50 30 Rest 20d=20m for the declination of Arcturus Anor l800: Noat that If the declination be north from Capricorn To Cancer Add the Difference But from Cancer To Capricorn: Substract the difference vizd from 270⁢degrs of Right Ascension To 90d: Add the difference Then from 90⁢degs: of Right Ascension to 270⁢degs Substract the difference, The declination Being North but If the declination Be South the Contrarye. Then from 270d: To :90d: I Substract the difference Then from 90d To :270 I add &c.

17,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,Letter to Edmund Halley on the doctrine of projectiles and motions of the heavens,EL/N1/55,20 June 1686,England,"['English', 'Latin']","55Newton 1455 Sir In order to let you know the case between Mr Hook & me I gave you an account of what past between us in our Letters so far as I could remember. For tis long since they were writ & I do not know that I have seen them since. I am almost confident by circumstances that Sir Chr. Wren knew the duplicate proportion when I gave him a visit, & then Mr Hook (by his book Cometa written afterward) will prove the last of us three that knew it. I intended in this Letter to let you understand the case fully but it being a frivolous business, I shal content my self to give you the heads of it in short: vizt that I never extended the duplicate proportion lower then to the superficies of the earth & before a certain demonstration I found the last year have suspected it did not reach accurately enough down so low: & therefore in the doctrine of projectiles never used it nor considered the motions of the heavens: & consequently Mr Hook could not from my Letters which were about Projectiles & the regions descending hence to the center conclude me ignorant of the Theory of the Heavens. That what he told me of the duplicate proportion was erroneous, namely that it reacht down from hence to the center of the earth. That it is not candid to require me now to confess my self in print then ignorant of the duplicate proportion in the heavens for no other reason but because he had told it me in the case of projectiles & so upon mistaken grounds accused me of that ignorance. That in my answer to his first letter I refused his correspondence, told him I had laid Philosophy aside, sent him only the experiment of Projectiles (rather shortly hinted then carefully described) in complement to swieeten my Answer, expected to heare no further from him, could scarce perswade my self to answer his second letter, did not answer his third, was upon other things, thought no further of philosophical matters then his letters put me upon it, & therefore may be allowed not to have had my thoughts of that kind about me so well at that time. That by the same reason he concludes me then ignorant of the duplicate proportion he may as well conclude me ignorant of the rest of that Theory I had read before in his books. That in one of my papers writ (I cannot say in what year but I am sure some time before I had any correspondence with Mr Oldenburg & that's) above fifteen years ago, the proportion of the forces of the Planets from the Sun reciprocally duplicate to their distances from him is exprest & the proportion of our gravity to the Moon's conatus recedendi a centro Terræ is calculated thô not accurately enough. That when Hugenius put out his Horologium Oscillatorium a copy being presented to me; in my letter of thanks to him I gave those rules in the end thereof a particular commendation for their usefulness in Philosophy, & added out of my aforesaid paper an instance of their usefulness in comparing the forces of the Moon from the earth & earth from the Sun in determining a Probleme about the Moons phase & putting a limit to the Sun's parallax. Which shews that I had then my eye upon comparing the forces of the Planets arising from their circular motion & understood it: so that a while after when Mr Hook propounded the Probleme solemnly in the end of his Attempt to prove the motion of the earth, if I had not known the duplicate proportion before I could not but have found it now. Between 10 & 11 years ago there was an Hypothesis of mine registred in your books, wherein I hinted a cause of gravity towards the earth Sun & Planets with the dependance of the celestial motions thereon: in which the proportion of the decrease of gravity from the superficies of the Planet (thô for brevities sake not there exprest) can be no other then reciprocally duplicate of the distance from the center. And I hope I shall not be urged to declare in print that I understood not the obvious mathematical conditions of my own Hypothesis. But grant I received it afterwards from Mr Hook, yet have I as great a right to it as to the Ellipsis. For as Kepler knew the Orb to be not circular but oval & guest it to be Elliptical, so Mr Hook without knowing what I have found out since his letters to me, can know no more but that the proportion was duplicate quam proximè at great distances from the center, & only guest it to be so accurately & guest amiss in extending that proportion down to the very center, whereas Kepler guest right at the Ellipsis. And so Mr Hook found less of the Proportion then Kepler of the Ellipsis. There is so strong an objection against the accurateness of this proportion, that without my Demonstrations, to which Mr Hook is yet a stranger, it cannot be beleived by a judicious Philosopher to be any where accurate. And so in stating this business I do pretend to have done as much for the proportion as for the Ellipsis & to have as much right to the one from Mr Hook & all men as to the other from Kepler. And therefore on this account also he must at least moderate his pretenses. The Proof you sent me I like very well. I designed the whole to consist of three books, the second was finished last summer being short & only wants transcribing & drawing the cuts fairly. Some new Propositions I have since thought on which I can as well let alone. The third wants the Theory of Comets. In Autumn last I spent two months in calculations to no purpose for want of a good method, which made me afterwards return to the first Book & enlarge it with divers Propositions some relating to Comets others to other things found out last Winter. The third I now designe to suppress. Philosophy is such an impertinently litigious Lady that a man had as good be engaged in Law suits as come neare as have to do with her. I found it so formerly & now I no sooner come near her again but she gives me warning. The two first books without the third will not so well beare the title of Philosophiæ naturalis Principia Mathematica & therefore I had altered it to this De motu corporum libri duo: but upon second thoughts I retain the former title. Twill help the sale of the book which I ought not to diminish now tis yours. The Articles are with the largest to be called by that name. If you please you may change the word to sections, thô it be not material. In the first page I have struck out the words uti posthac docebitur as referring to the third book. Which is all at present from Your affectionate friend & humble Servant Is: Newton. Cambridge June 20. 1686. Since my writing this letter I am told by one who had it from another lately present at one of your meetings, how that Mr Hook should there make a great stir pretending I had all from him & desiring they would see that he had justice done him. This carriage towards me is very strange & undeserved, so that I cannot forbeare in stating that point of justice to tell you further, that he has published Borell's Hypothesis in his own name & the asserting of this to himself & completing it as his own, seems to me the ground of all the stir he makes. Borel did something in it & wrote modestly, he has such a way done nothing & yet written in such a way as if he knew & had sufficiently hinted all but what remained to be determined by the drudgery of calculations & observations, excusing himself from that labour by reason of his other business: whereas he should rather have excused himself by reason of his inability. For tis plain by his words he knew not how to go about it. Now is not this very fine? Mathematicians that find out, settle & do all the business must content themselves with being nothing but dry calculators & drudges & another that does nothing but pretend & grasp at all things must carry away all the invention as55– as well of those that were to follow him as of those that went before. Much after the same manner were his letters writ to me, telling me that gravity in descent from hence to the center of the earth was reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of the altitude, that the figure described by projectiles in this region would be an Ellipsis & that all the motions of the heavens were thus to be accounted for: & this he did in such a way as if he had found out all & knew it most certainly. And upon this information I must now acknowledge in print I had all from him & so did nothing my self but drudge in calculating demonstrating & writing upon the inventions of this great man. And yet after all, the first of those three things he told me is fals & very unphilosophical, the second is as fals & the third was more then he knew or could affirm me ignorant of by any thing that past between us in our letters. Nor do I understand by what right he claims it as his own. For as Borell wrote long before him that by a tendency of the Planets towards the sun like that of gravity or magnetism the Planets would move in Ellipses, so Bullialdus wrote that all force respecting the Sun as its center & depending on matter must be reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of the distance from the center, & used that very argument for it by which you, Sir, in the last Transactions have proved this ratio in gravity. Now if Mr Hook from this general Proposition in Bullialdus might learn the proportion in gravity, why must this proportion here go for his invention? My letter to Hugenius which I mentioned above was directed to Mr Oldenburg who used to keep the Originals. His papers came into Mr Hooks possession. Mr Hook knowing my hand might have the curiosity to look into that letter & thence take the notion of comparing the forces of the Planets arising from their circular motion & so what he wrote to me afterwards about the rate of gravity, might be nothing but the fruit of my own Garden. And its more then I can affirm that the duplicate proportion was not exprest in that letter. However he knew it not (ias I gather from his books) till five years after any Mathematician could have told it him. For when Hugenius had told how to find the force in all cases of circular motion, he had told them how to do it in this as well as all others. And so the honour of doing it in this way is due to Hugenius. For another five years after to claim it as his own invention, is as if some Mechanick who had learnt the Art of surveying from a Master should afterwards claim the surveying of this or that piece of ground for his own invention & keep a heavy quarter to be in print for it. But what if this surveyor be a bungler & give in an erroneous survey? Mr Hook has erred in the invention he pretends to & his error is the cause of all the stirr he makes. For his extending the duplicate proportion down to the center (which I do not) made him correct me & tell me the rest of his Theory as a new thing to me & now stand upon it that I had all from that his letter: notwithstanding that he had told it to all the world before & I had seen it in his printed books all but the proportion. And why should I record a man for an Invention who founds his claim upon an error therein & on that score gives me trouble? He imagins he obliged me by telling me his Theory, but I thought my self disobliged by being upon his own mistake corrected magisterially & taught a Theory which every body knew & I had a truer notion of then himself. Should a man who thinks himself knowing, & loves to shew it in correcting & instructing others, come to you when you are busy, & notwithstanding your excuse, press discourses upon you & through his own mistakes pr correct you & multiply discourses & then make this use of it, to boast that he taught you all he spake & oblige you to acknowledge it & cry out injury & injustice if you do not, I beleive you would think him a man of a strange unsociable temper. Mr Hooks letters in several respects abounded too much with that humour which Hevelius & others complain of & therefore he may do well in time to consider whether after this new provocation I be much more bound (in doing him that justice he claims) to make an honourable mention of him in print, especially since this is the third time that he has given me trouble in this kind. For your further satisfaction in this business, I beg the favour you would consult your books for a paper of mine entitled, An Hypothesis explaining the properties of light. It was dated Decemb. 7th 1675 & registred in your Book about Ian or Feb following. Not far from the beginning there is a Paragraph ending with these words. And as the Earth so perhaps may the Sun imbibe this spirit copiously to conserve his shining & keep the Planets from receding further from him & they that will may also suppose that this spirit affords or carries thither the solary fewel & materiall principle if light: And that the vast ethereal spaces between us & the stars are for a sufficient repository for this food if the Sun & Planets. But this if the constitution if ethereal natures by the by. In these & the foregoing words you have the common cause of gravity towards the earth Sun & all the Planets, & that by this cause the Planets are kept in their Orbs about the Sun. And this is all the Philosophy Mr Hook pretends I had from his letters some years after, the duplicate proportion only excepted. The preceding words contein the cause of the phænomena of gravity as we find it on the surface of the earth without any regard to the various distances from the center: For at first I designed to write of nothing more. Afterwards, as my manuscript shews, I interlined the words above cited relating to the heavens, & in so short & transitory an interlined hint of things, the expression of the proportion may well be excused. But if you consider the nature of the Hypothesis you'l find that gravity decreases upward & can be no other from the superficies of the Planet then reciprocally duplicate of the distance from the center, but downwards that proportion does not hold. This was but an Hypothesis & so to be looked upon only as one of my guesses which I did not rely on: but it sufficiently explains to you why in considering the descent of a body down to the center I used not the duplicate proportion. In the small ascent & descent of projectiles above the earth the variation of gravity is so inconsiderable that Mathematicians neglect it. Hence the vulgar Hypothesis with them is uniform gravity. And why might not I as a Mathematician use it frequently without thinking on the philosophy of the heavens or beleiving it to be philosophically true? For Mr Edmund Halley.

18,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,Letter to Edmund Halley on work on ellipses and the descent of falling bodies,EL/N1/56,14 July 1686,England,['English'],"5656 July 14. 1686. Sir I have considered your proposal about wooden cuts & beleive it will be much convenienter for the Reader & may be sufficiently handsome but I leave it to your determination. If you go this way, then I desire you would divide the first figure into these two. I crouded them into one to save the trouble of altering the numbers in the schemes you have. I am very sensible of the great kindness of the Gentlemen of your Society to me, far beyond what I could ever expect or deserve & know how to distinguish between their favour & anothers humour. Now I understand he was in some respects misrepresented to me I wish I had spared the Postscript in my last. This is true, that his Letters occasioned my finding the method of determining Figures, which when I had tried in the Ellipsis, I threw the calculation by being upon other studies & so it rested for about 5 yeares till upon your request I sought for that paper, & not finding it did it again & reduced it into the Propositions shewed you by Mr Paget: but for the duplicate proportion I can affirm that I gathered it from Keplers Theorem about 20 yeares ago. And so Sir Christopher Wren's examining the Ellipsis over against the Focus shews that he knew it many yeares ago before he left of his enquiry after the figure by an imprest motion & a descent compounded together. There was another thing in Mr Hooks letters which he will think I had from him. He told me that my proposed experiment about the descent of falling bodies was not the only way to prove the motion ofthe earth & so added the experiment of your Pendulum Clock at St Hellena as an argument of gravities being lessened at the equator by the diurnal motion. The experiment was new to me but not the notion. For in that very paper which I told you was writ some time above 15 yeares ago & to the best of my memory was writ 18 or 19 years ago, I calculated the force of ascent at the Equator arising from the earth's diurnal motion in order to know what would be the diminution of gravity thereby. But yet to do this business right is a thing of far greater difficulty then I was aware of. A third thing there was in his letters, which was new to me & I shall acknowledge it if I make use of it. It was the deflexion of falling fbodies to the south east in our Latitude. And now having sincerely told you the case between Mr Hook & me I hope I shall be free for the future from the prejudice of his Letters. I have considered how best to compose the present dispute & I think it may be done by the inclosed Scholium to the fourth Proposition. In turning over some old papers I met with another demonstration of that Proposition, which I have added at the end of this Scholium. Which is all at present from Your affectionate Friend & humble Servant Is. Newton. Mr Newton July. 14 1686 Letters from Mr Newton Aug. 20. July. 14. Octob. 18",NATP00326,1686-07-14 00:00:00
19,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,Letter to Edmund Halley about Newton's correspondence with Huygens on vis centrifuga,EL/N1/57,27 July 1686,England,"['English', 'Latin']","57Newton 1657 Sir Yesterday I unexpectedly struck upon a copy of the Letter I told you of to Hugenius. Tis in the hand of one Mr John Wickins who was then my chamber fellow & is now Parson of Stoak Edith neare Monmoth & so it is authentick. It begins thus being directed to Mr Oldenburg: ""Sir I received your letters with M. Hugens kind present, which I have viewed with great satisfaction, finding it full of very subtile & useful speculations very worthy of the Author. I am glad that we are to expect another discourse of the Vis centrifuga, which speculation may prove of good use in natural Philosophy & Astronomy as well as Mechanicks. Thus for instance, if the reason why the same side of the moon is ever towards the earth be the greater conatus of the other side to recede from it, it will follow (upon supposition ofthe earths motion about the Sun) that the greatest distance of the sun from the earth is to the greatest distance of the Moon from the earth, not greater then 10000 to 56 & therefore the parallax of the Sun not less then 5610000 of the Parallax of the Moon: because were the Sun's distance less in proportion to that of the Moon she would have a greater conatus from the Sun then from the earth. I thought also that sometime that the Moons Libration might depend upon her conatus from the Sun & earth compared together till I apprehended a better cause."" Thus far this Letter concerning the vis centrifuga. The rest of it for the most part concerning colours, is printed in the Ph. Transactions of July 21 1673. Num. 96. Now from these words its evident that I was at that time versed in the Theory of the force arising from circular motion, & had an eye upon the forces of the Planets, knowing how to compare them by the proportions of their periodical revolutions & distances from the center they move about, an instance of which you have here in the comparison of the forces of the Moon arising from her menstrual motion about the Earth & annual about the Sun. So then in this Theory I am plainly before Mr Hook. For he about a year after in his Attempt to prove the Motion of the Earth, declared expressly that the degrees by which gravity decreased he had not then experimentally verified, that is he knew not how to gather it from phænomena, & therefore he there recommends it to the prosecution of others. Now though I do not find the duplicate proportion exprest in this letter (as I hoped it might) thet if you compare this passage of it here transcribed with that Hypothesis of mine registred by Mr Oldenburg in your Book, you will see that I then understood it. For I there suppose that the descending spirit acts upon bodies here on the superficies of the earth with force proportional to the superficies of their parts, which cannot be unless the diminution of its velocity in acting upon the first parts of any body it meets with be recompensed by the increase of its density arising from that retardation. Whether this be true is not material. It suffices that it was the Hypothesis. Now if this spirit descend from above with uniform velocity, its density & consequently its force will be reciprocally proportionall to the square of its distance from the center. But if it descend with accelerated motion, its density will every where diminish as much as its velocity increases, & so its force (according to the Hypothesis) will be the same as before that is still reciprocally as the square of its distance from the center. In short as these things compared together shew that I was before Mr Hook in what he pretends to have been my Master so I learnt nothing by his letters but this that bodies fall not only to the east but also in our latitude to the south. In the rest his correcting & informing me was to be complain'ded of. And thô his correcting my Spiral occasioned my finding the Theorem by which I afterward examined the Ellipsis; yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things & for his dogmaticalnes in writing as if he had found the Ellip motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it after I saw by what method it was to be done.

I send you inclosed the beginning of this Scholium with the 63d figure as I would have them printed. I thank you heartily for giving me notice that it was amiss. The ground of the transmutation of a trapezium into a paralleglogram I lay down pag 87 in these words: ""Nam rectæ quævis convergentes transmutantur in parallelas, adhibendo pro radio ordinato primo AO lineam quamvis rectam quæ per concursum convergentium transit: id adeo quia concursus ille hoc pacto abit in infinitum, lineæ autem parallelæ sunt quæ ad punctum infinitè distans tendunt."" In the figure pag 86 conceive the curve HGI to be produced both ways till it meet & intersect it self any where in the radius ordinatus primus AO: & when the point G moving up & down in the curve HI arrives at that intersection point, I say the point g moving in like manner up & down in the curve hi will become infinitely distant. For the point G falling upon the line OA, the line OD point D will fall upon the point A & the line OD upon the line OA & so becoming parallel to AB their intersection point d will become infinitely distant & consequently the line dg will become infinitlely distant & so will its point g. Q.E.D. So then if any two lines of the primary figure HGID intersect in the radius ordinatus primus AO their intersection in the new figure hgid shall become infinitely distant & therefore if the two intersecting lines be right ones they shall become parallel. For right lines which tend to a point infinitely distant do not intersect one another & diverge but are parallel. Therefore if in the primary figure there be any Trapezium whose opposite sides converge to points in the radius ordinatus primus OA those sides in the new figure shal become parallel & so the trapezium be converted into a parallelogram.

Sir I thank you for your letter of Apr. 21. by Mr Conan. But I can by no means admit your excuse for not publishing your Treatise of Light & Colours. You say, you dare not yet publish it. And why not yet? Or, if not now, when then? You adde, least it create you some trouble. What trouble now, more then at another time? Pray consider, how many years this hath lyen upon your hands allready: And, while it lyes upon your hands, it will stil be some trouble. (For I know your thoughts must needs be still running upon it.) But, when published, that trouble will be over. You think, perhaps, it may occasion some Letters (of exceptions) to you, which you shal be obliged to Answer. What if so? 'twill be at your chaise whether to Answer them or not. The Treatise will answer for itself. But, Are you troubled with no letters for not publishing it? For, I suppose, your other friends call upon you for it, as well as I; & are as little satisfyed with the delay. Mean while, you loose the Reputation of it, and we the Benefit. So that you are neither just to yourself, nor kind to the publike. And perhaps some other may get some scraps of the notion, & publish it as his own; & then 'twil be His, not yours; though he may perhaps never attain to the tenth part of what you be allready master of. Consider, that 'tis now about Thirty years since you were master of those notions about Fluxions and Infinite Series; but you have never published ought of it to this day, (which is worse than nonumqꝫue prematur in annum.) 'Tis true, I have endeavoured to do you right in that point. But if I had published the same or like notions, without naming you; & the world possessed of anothers Calculus differentialis, instead of your Fluxions: How should this, or the next Age, know of your share therein? And even what I have sayd, is but playing an After-game for you; to recover (precariously) ex post liminio what you had let slip in its due time. And, even yet, I see you make no great hast to publish those Letters, which are to be my Vouchers for what I say of it. And even those Letters at first, were rather extorted from you, than purely voluntary. You may say, perhaps, the last piece of this concerning Colours is not quite finished. It may be so: (and perhaps never will.) But pray let us have what is. And, while that is printing, you may (if ever) perfect the rest. But if, during the delay, you chance to DyDie, or those papers chance to take fire (as some others have done,) 'tis all lost, both as to you, & as to the publike. It hath been an old complaint, that an Englishman never knows when a thing is well. (But will still be over-doing, & thereby looseth or spoils many times what was well before.) I own that Modesty is a Vertue; but too much Diffidence (especially as the world now goes) is a Fault. And if men will never publish ought till it be so perfect as that nothing more can be added to it: themselves & the publike will both be loosers. I hope, Sir, you will forgive me this Freedome (while I speak the sense of others as well as my own,) or else I know not how we thus forgive these delays. I could say a great deal more: But, if you think I have sayd too much allready, pray forgive this kindness of Your real friend & humble servant, John Wallis. Dr Gregory gives you his service.",NATP00191,1695-04-30 00:00:00

Sir I have taken the pains to transcribe a fair copy of your two letters, which I wish were printed. I send it you with this, because I suspect there may be some little mistakes either in the Calculation or Transcribing in some places, which therefore I desire you will please carefully to peruse, & correct to your own mind, & then (if you please) remit to me. I would have subjoined them (with your good leave) to the second volume of my Opera Mathematica if I had thought of it a little sooner, before that had been sent abroad; but 'tis now, I think, too late. If any of your Book-sellers will undertake the Printing of it; I think Oxford the most convenient place for it; Because here we have most of the Cuts allready, & furniture fit for it; & our Compositors are acquainted with this kind of troublesome work; which to others unacquainted with it will seem strange. And Mr Caswell or I will see to the correcting of the Press. But I find that these letters do refer to two Letters of Leibnitz, which I have never seen: If you have copies of them by you, it would be proper to print those with these. But while I suggest this, I would not have you neglect or defer printing your Treatise of Light & Colours, even though your third part be not quite finished. And you will, after, have time enough to adjust the Moons Motions. I gave you my Reasons against great delay in my last, which I need not repeat. I have taken the liberty in this transcript, for Collinsius, to substitute all along Collinius; because it is a softer sound, & (I think) more proper. For Collin, Robert, Richard, Roger, Henry, William, &c being originally Proper Nounes, I take s, in Collins, Roberts, Richards, &c, to be the Formative of a Patronymick, (and to signify the same as Collinson, Robertson, &c) for which, in Latine, I would supply a Latine Formative ius (as in Martius from Mars, Martis, & many others) and would therefore change to say Robert Collinius, Robertius, Richardius, Rogerius, Henricius, Guilielmius, &c. raterrather than Collinsius &c; And so Hobbius, Hugenius, rather than Hobbesius, Huginsius. But if you like the other better; I am content. You may please to let me know, what time it was that you first lighted on these notions of Infinite Series; I guessed formerly (being not near you to ask) that it was about the year 1663; If it were sooner, you may please to rectify me therein.

The plague was in Cambridge in both the years 1665 & 1666 but it was in that year 1666 that I was in the Country. absent from Cambridge & therefore I have set down an amendment of the year. I wrote to you lately that I found the method of converging series in the winter between the years 1665 & 1666. For that was the earliest mention of it I could find then amongst my papers. But meeting since with the notes which in the year 1664 upon my first reading of Vieta's works Schooten's Miscelanies & your Arithmetica Infinitorum I took out of those books (which was done in the year 1664) I & finding among these notes my deduction of the these series for the circle & Hyperbola & some other figures out of yours in your Arithmetica Infinitorum for squaring the circle & Hyperbola: I collect that it was in the year 1664 that I deduced these series out of yours for squaring the circle these figures with some others Then is also among these notes Mercators series for squaring the Hyperbola found by the same method with some others. But I cannot find that I understood the invention of these series by division & extraction of roots or made any further progress in this business before the writer which was between the years 1665 & 1666. But in that winter & that spring following by the use of Division & extraction of roots I brought that method to be general, & then the plague made me leave cCambridge. But I do not think it requisite that you should make a particular mention of these things. I believe you have said enough in the beginning of your 91th Chapter. In your third Chapter you have given us a collation of the Arabic cyphers with ours both old & modern. The other day looking into Taverniere's travells into India pa lib. 1 pag 23 I met with the cyphers now used all over India. They are these. qɀε४yʒ9ﺡ७q.q..q...q.... 12345678910100100010000 Our old figures 2, 4 & 5 & 8 (thus marked ɀ _X४ y ﺡ) seem to be borrowed from these. I communicated the Postscript of your letter to our Vicechancellor together with such other Papers as your messenger shewed me. That His answer was that he had been so much pressed by the heads of Colleges upon several occasions to admit nothing of this kind without full evidence that the petitioner was a true object of charity, that feared some of the Heads would be displeased if he should he could not give leave without better evidence then he had in this case least he should meet with a new check from the Heads. He exprest a great great respect to your letter & said that he lived within five miles of Sandwich & knew the hands of most of the gentry there & had the case come recommended by some of them whome he could have confided in he would have admitted it, but for the seale of the corporation he represented that he knew they sometimes granted it upon too sleight occasions to get rid of troublesome people & therefore he could lay no great stress upon that. Nor did he think the heads of Colleges could be satisfied without better Testimonials. Mr Deeds he said he knew, but seemed to lay no stress upon his testimony. I beleive he mistook the man, because I since heare there are more of that name. He desired that you should be will satisfied about the business & so telling him that I would represent it to you I took my leave & giving your Messenger ten shillings was fain to dismis him with this answer. Last summer when the Vicechancellor stood to be our Burgess I voted against him & so have can challenge no interest in him tho he is very fair & civil to me.

That there is, in our Ecclesiastical Computation of our Paschal Tables, somewhat of Disorder, is not to be denyed. But I am very doubtful that, if we go to alter that, it will be attended with greater Mischief than the present Inconvenience. It is dangerous removing the Old Land-marks. Καχὸν εὖ χείμενον ὀυ κινητέον. A thing (of Moment) when once settled (though with some Inconvenience should not rashly be altered. Such changes may have a further Prospect than men at first sight are aware of; & may be attended with those Evils, which are not presently apprehended. In the business of Geography; upon removing the First-Meridian (in some plausible pretence) from where Ptolomy had placed it (though a thing at first arbitrary it is now come to pass, that we have no First-Meridian, at all; that is, none fixed; but every New Map-maker placeth his First-Meridian where he pleaseth, which hath brought a great Confusion in Geography. And as to the point in Question; the Disorder in the Paschal Tables, was a thing noted & complained of, for three or four hundred years, before Pope Gregory did (unhappily) attempt the Correction of the Calendar: But it was, all that time, thought adviseable, rather to suffer that Inconvenience, than, by Correcting it, to run the hazard of a greater Mischief. And it had been much better if it had so continued to this Day, rather than Pope Gregory (upon his own Single Authority) should take upon him to impose a Law on all the Churches, Kingdoms, & States of Christendom, to alter both their Ecclesiastical & Civil year, for a worse form, than what before we had. Or, if merely upon account of the Paschal Tables (for he made no other pretense) it were thought reasonable to make a Change; he might have corrected the Pascal Tables (or given us the new Paschal Tables instead of those of Dionysius,) without altering the Civil year: which hath introduced the confusion (which we now complain of) of the Old and New Stile. And which now can never be remedied; unless All Nations should, at once, agree upon One; which is not to be supposed. I say, at once, for if some sooner & some later do alter their Stile, the Confusioon (in History) will yet be greater than now it is. 'Tis true, that, upon pretense of the Popes (usurped) Supremacy in Spirituals (and in Temporals also in order to Spirituals) most Popish Countries (but I think, not all) have submitted their Civil year (as well as their Ecclesiastical) to the Single Authority of the Pope's Bull. But your Grace knows very well, that the Church of England had (long before this pretended Correction) renounced the Pope's Supremacy; and (that being supposed) there is no pretense for the Pope of Rome's imposing a Law on the Church and Kingdome of England (to change our Ecclesiastical & Civil year,) more than, in Us, for that in Rome. And, upon this account, the Church & Kingdome of England, did, at first, not admit of that change; & have, hitherto, retained our Old Constitution of the Julian year, notwithstanding the Pope's pretended Supremacy. And I see not why we should now admit it, after having so long renounced it. And And really (though it may not yet appear & be owned above board; and those who now press for alteration, be not aware of it, & be far from any Popish design;) I cannot but think there is, at the bottom, a latent Popish interest, which (under other specious Pretenses) sets it on foot; in order to obtain (in practise) a kind of tacit submission to the Pope's Supremacy, or owning his Authority. And though they be so wise as to say nothing of it at present (for the Bait is to hide the Hook, till the Fish be caught;) they will please themselves to have gained de Facto, what in words we disclaim. For there is nothing but the Pope's Bull , which should induce the Change of the (Civil) Julian year (which is much better) for the New Gregorian. For, the Equinox going backward, (for ten or eleven Minutes each year,) is very inconsiderable: and which, in Celestial Computations, is easily rectified; as are many other Inequalities of much greater concernment. And, I think, it was never pretended that the Civil year must needs agree (exactly to a minute) with the Celestial. And, if never so much affected, it is impossible to be had: For the Solar year, & the Sidereal year, differ more from each other, than the Julian from either, which is a Middle betwixt them. And the Seat of Easter (which only concerns the Ecclesiastical, not the Civil year;) may easily be rectified, if need be, without affecting the Civil year at all. Or, if not Rectified; the Celebration of Easter a Week or a Month sooner or later, doth not influence at all our solemn Commemoration of Christ's Resurrection. We celebrate the Birth of Christ, on December 25, (and as well on that day as any other.) For which I know no other reason, but, that the Roman Saturnalia were celebrated around that time; and it was tought convenient to exchange That, for a Christian Solemnity. For we have no assurance whether Christ were born in Winter or in Summer. And 'tis agreed by most (if not All) Chronologers, that, as to the Year of our Lord, the Annus Vulgaris is not the Annus Verus (though it be not agreed, how much it differ:) But it would be a horrible Confusion in History, if we should now go about to alter the Vulgar Account. All the pretense that I can understand for altering our Stile, is onely, that in so doing, we should agree with some of our Neighbours with whom we now Differ: But it will then be as true, that we shall Differ from others with whom we do now Agree. We should agree with France, but differ from Scotland (which, as to us, is more considerable) & with all others who yet follow the Old Stile. If it be said, that They, in time, may come so to do by Our Example. This would but make the Confusion yet Greater. For then we must be obliged not only to know what places use the new Stile; but, from what time they began so to do; if we would understand their Dates. And, if we should, by a new Law alter our Stile in England; this would not comprehend Scotland: And we cannot promise our Selves that they would presently comply also. For (according to the present Constitution of that Church) they are not so Pliable to comply with the Modes of Rome, as some in England are. And the business of Easter (which has the sole pretense of the first Alteration) would, to them, signifie nothing; who (according to their Constitution) observe no Easter at all; but do rather declare against it. And, when all is done, there will still be a necessity of keeping up the Distinction of Old-Stile and New-Stile, (which Pope Gregory's pretended Correction hath made necessary;) And, with that Distinction, things may be now as well adjusted, as if we should now Change our Stile. I forbear to discourse at large (that I bee not too tedious,) how much a better Constitution the Julian Year is, & more advisable, than the new Gregorian. Which is a thing so notorious, that no Astronomer (who understands the Methods of Astronomical calculations) though a Papist, can be ignorant of, however they may please to Dissemble it. Insomuch that (in their Astronomical Calculations) they are fain first to adjust their Calculations to the Julian Year, and thence transfer them to their new Gregorian. And, consequently, how unreasonable it is for us to exchange our Better Julian Year for one that is so much worse. It would be much more reasonadvisable reasonable (save that they will never be induce to part with ought, which may favour their Usurpations, how absurd so ever,) that the Papists should quit their New Gregorian, and return to their Old Julian Year. But I forbear to enlarge on this, (and many other things which might be alleged:) And humbly beg2 beg your Graces Pardon for having already given the trouble of so long a Letter. And am, My Lord, Your Graces most humble & Obedient Servant, John Wallis. To the Right Reverend Father in God, William Lord Bishop of Worcester; at White-hall Oxford June 30. 1699. May it please your Lordship, In a late Letter which I had the honour to receive from my Lord Arch-Bishop's Grace of Canterbury; His Grace was pleased to intimate, as a thing under consideration, about changing the Stile of our Civil Year. It may perhaps be Presumption in me () to interpose my thoughts with your Lordship, in a business of that nature. But I must needs it think a tender point to touch upon and which, if we attempt it, may be attended with greater Mischiefs, than we may at first be aware of, I adventured to say somewhat to that purpose, in a Letter to his Grace; But much more may be sayd. That the Difference of Stiles doth create some Confusion in History, is not to be denyed. (And it was very unhappy that Pope Gregory XIII did, in the last Century, attempt it.) But it is now unavoidable, & cannot be Remedyed. For it is not England onely, that useth the Julian Year; But all the Three Kingdoms, of England, Scotland, & Ireland; And all our Foreign Plantations, (which are not a few;) And the Two Kingdomes of Denmark and Sweden; the Protestant Cantons of Switzerland; and Four of the Seven United Provinces; And, how many more of the Protestants in Germany, I cannot presently say. And, if we should now change our Stile, in compliance with some of our Popish Neighbours from whom we Differ; we should then vary from the Protestants with whom we now Agree. And particularly from Scotland (with whom we are more concerned to agree than with France.) For we are not to presume that they will presently change, at the same time with Us. It is happy that they did comply with us in the late Revolution; (to be under the same King with us:) we cannot presume they will be so fond of Compliance in all the Modes of Rome. As is very evident in their not admitting Episcopacy, nor the Observation of Easter. (which latter, was the onely pPretense of first introducing the Gregorian year.) So that there will still be as great a necessity of SV. and SN. (Old-Stile and New-Stile) as now there is. Without which we shall be at loss, in History, to judge distinctly of Dates: and, with it, we are now as easy as if we change. If it be said, that other Protestants may, in time, be induced to follow our Example: Perhaps some may, (not All:) But this would make the Confusion yet Greater. For, thenceforth, we must be obliged (if we would be at a certainty in History) not onely to know what Countreys do use this or that Stile; but from what Time they began so to do. It would be much more advisable (if the Papists would be as compliant as they would have us to be,) for the Papists to return to their Old Julian year, than for us to imbrace their New Gregorian. And it might be much easyer effected. For, if the Pope could be persuaded to grant a Bull to that purpose; all the Papists would, at once, be as much obliged so to do, as, by Pope Gregorie's Bull, at first to vary from it. If it be sayd, There is no Hope'sHope of that: Then the Argument stands thus; If the Pope will not leave his pretended Supremacy, then we must Admit it. That the Julian Year is, in itself, a Better Form, & more Advisable, than the Gregorian, is undeniable: And, all Astronomers, even Papists themselves, (if not otherwise Bigoted, in favour of the Pope's Supremacy, and the Infallibility of the Roman Church) cannot but know it. Insomuch that, in many cases, they are fain (or find it advisable) first to adjust their Calculations to the Julian Year, & thence transfer them to the Gregorian. And there is no Inducement for our changing our Better Year, for a Worse, but onely in Compliance with the Pope's pretended Supremacy; not onely over all Churches and Kingdomes, but even the Celestial Motions; (as Pope Gregory, in his Bull, doth wisely pretend.) Now it is well known, that, long before Pope Gregorie's Bull, England had renounced the Pope's Supremacy (and are therefore unconcerned in that Bull:) And I see no reason reason why (after so long a Disclaimer) we should be now fond to Re-admit it. But, what greater Evidence (of our owning that Authority) can (in practise) be expected, than, Obeying their Com̄mmands, in things (otherwise) Unadvisable? Hoc Ithacus velit et magno mercentur Atridae And no doubt but the hand of Joab is in the matter, though perhaps we do not see it. As to our selves: this cannot be done without Altering the Act of Uniformity, and Altering the Common-Prayer-Book. (For, at least, all the Calendar must be new framed.) And your Lordship knows, how warm some were a while since, against Touching that in the least; or, so much as considering (on the King's Com̄mmission to that purpose) whether ought in it might be Changed for the Better. If yet your Lordship think it necessary, that the Seat of Easter should be Rectifyed: that may easily be done, without Altering the Civil year. For if, in the Rule for Easter, instead of saying Next after the One and Twentieth of March, you say, Next after the Vernal Equinox, the work is done. (And we might be excused the trouble of Paschal Tables; and, the intricate Perplexities of Gregorian Epacts.) For, then, every Almanack will tell you, when it is Equinox, and when it is Full Moon, for the present year, (without disturbing the Civil Account.) And this Pope Gregory might as well done, without disturbing the Account of Christendome. But, if he would needs disturb the Civil Year; he should have Rectified it; (not to the time of the Nicene Council, but) to the time of our Saviour's Birth. For our Epocha, is not from the Nicene Council, but, from the Birth of Christ. We do not say, Anno Niceni Consilii, but Anno Domini. And most certain it is, that, at our Saviour's Birth, the Vernal Equinox, was not on the One and twentieth of March, (as this New Account would suppose,) but nearer to the Five and twentieth. It is alleged as an Argument, why Now to change; because the Difference, which, this Year, is but Ten days, will, Next year, be Eleven days. But, my Lord, we must be very weak Disputants, to be caught by such a Fallacy; (which is barely Begging the Question.) The Point in Question, is not Why Now, but Why at all. It is not We that have departed from Them; but They from Us. The Julian year was Their year, as well as Ours, till the the year 1585; (when a Fancy took Pope Gregory to Exchange a Better year for a Worse, and disturb the Christian World.) And then the Argument (if it signify any thing) stands thus; The farther They be gone astray, the more reason there is that we should follow them. I should rather argue, The more Reason there is why They should Return (to that from whence they went astray.) We are as we were, (and as They were till that time.) And the Reason why We did not Then change; remains still good, why we should not make that change at all. If this Point had been started in our late King James's time; I desire your Lordship to consider, with what face it would have looked. And, if the Mask be taken ofoff, the Face is still the same. I find, it was started, during the time of our Civil Wars (about the year 1644,) by those about the King, when Oxford was the King's Head-quarters; But itthe Project did not then succeed, by reason that the King's Party (in that contest) were not Prevalent. And your Lordship knows very well, how much it was to the Prejudice of the King's Cause, that those on the other side would suppose him to be too much influenced by Popish Counsels: Of which, this was a great Instance. And no doubt they will be as ready to push it forward (upon any the least pretense) whenever they find us soft enough to receive the impression. Not perhaps under the Names of Julian and Gregorian, (for the word Gregorian speaks too plain;) But under the softer Terms of Old-Stile & New Stile. Otherwise; so much weight would not be layd upon so slight a Pretense. For the Addition of Old-Stile or New-Stile, will certainly Determine the Difference of Eleven days in the Next Century, as of Ten days in this; if nothing else were in the wind. We have been too oftoften caught in such Snares. I forbear to say more (though more might be sayd) that I may not too much presume on your Lordship's Leisure. But am, My Lord, Your Lordship's very humble Servant, John Wallis.",NATP00195,1699-06-01 00:00:00

For he that published it wrote that Mr Mr Leibnitz being at nunc Viennæ Austriæ agens ob distantiam locorum nondum vidit libellum in Anglia nuper editum (i.e. Commercium Epistolicum) & gave an account of Mr Leibnitz's referring the matter to the judgment of a primary Mathematician: things which he could not know without keeping a correspondence with Mr Leibnitz. 3 The names of the great Mathematician & of the publisher are therefore known to Mr Leibnitz, & since they were imployed by him he is answerable for the whole untill he produces their names; & if he refuses to produce their names he will deserve to be reputed the author of what has been published by his means, the Libel especially since the style is tho pretended to be written by other nameless authors. For the style is not unlike that of Mr Leibnitz. And the reflexions wherewith Mr Newton is treated are in pursuance of the designe of Mr Leibnitz in his expressed in his two Letters to the Secretary of the Royal Society, where he decliened a dispute with Mr Keil & pressed appealed to jthe judgment of Mr Newton in order to pick a quarrel with him. After this Libel had been dispersed in Germany & some other places it was sent to the Hague with a paper of Remarques upon it to be published in the Journal Literaire. And the Remarques were as follows The author of the Remarques tells us tha The Remarques were upon the differences pretended to be between Mr Newton & Mr Leibnitz. The author of the Remarques pursues the designe of Mr Leibnitz declining to meddle with Mr Keil & calling the above dispute representing the dispute to be between Mr Newton Leibnitz & Mr Keil Newton. He tells us that Mr Leibnitz had not yet seen the Commercium Epistolicum that he was still had not yet sent his complaint reasons to the Royal Society in England as being superfluous in a cause beleiving the matter sufficiently evident so just; with other things which were known only to Mr Leibnitz himself & those to whom he communicated them. And therefore the Author of these Remarks is also known to Mr Leibnitz & might copy from his Letters, or be Mr Leibnitz himself. The Remarques are as follows. Let this note be in the Margin. Mr Leibnitz wrote to the Society to condemn Mr Keil without a hearing. The Society hath equal authority over them both. & Mr Leibnitz in complaining hath authorized the Society to leave the matter between them & obliged himself to produce his reasons least his complaint should go for a calumny be deemed a calumny.

Situm est fatum in voluntate Dei. Quicquid ipse velit futurum est. Sed velle non cogitur cæco aliquo fato. Mundum hoc loco vel hoc tempore creari non est ex fato cæco sed electione Dei. Corpora animalium sapienter formari non est ex fato cæco sed consilio Dei Plancta primarios in orbibus concentricis circum solem vel Iovem vel Saturnum vel Terram ferri est ex fato ferri idqꝫue in eodem planiso et, secundum eundem ordinem signorum, ferri non est ex fato cæco sed consilio consilio et electione Conditoris.

[Incidunt enim radij in vacuum.] Et hæc attractio Attractiones agutem esse spiritum electricum vitri exinde colligere Ex supradictis manifestum est quod hic spiritus, si per frictionem vitri commoveatur, exit potest ex vitro ad distantias satis magnas et vel cavendo vel etiampost inicum suum si satis agitatur ut jam d lucem est quando emittet. Nam spiritus quei per agitationes suas satis habeat virium ad lucem emittendam, satis habebit virium ad radios ejus inflectendos & refringendos. Eadem est actionis ratio in utroqꝫue casu. Non alia vis ad motum radiorum imputandum retardandum vel sistendum quamd ad communicandum motum eorum generandum vel requisitur. Ubi spiritus electricus uniformis est, radij lucis per ipsum transeunt in lineis rectis, & corpora per quæ transeunt sunt pelludcida. Ab inæquali densitate spiritus oritur hujus priuntur radiorum incurvationes refractiones & reflectiones in partibus internis corporum & ab his radiorum perturbationibus oritur opacitas corporum. Opaca igitur sunt corpora quæ vel poris majoribus & fissuris vel partibus inæqualiter densis abundant. Et si corpus pelludcidum particulis vel densioribus vel rarioribus & quod densitatem & magnitudinem homogeneis abundent, hæ particulæ pro densitate et magnitudine sua reflectent genus aliquod radiorum ........cum articulis illis reflectunt. Nam spiritus electricus ubi densior est radios lucis ad se attrahit, ideoqꝫue densior pars vibrationis ubi radios sequitur ipsos disponit retardat, ubi præcedit ipsos accelerat, et sic radij per a vibrationibus spiritus electrici accelerantur & retardantur per vices et pro crassitudine cuticulæ pellucidæ ubi vel incident in ulteriorem ejus superficiem ubi vel tardiores sunt vel velociores et priore casu reflectentur posteriore a sf posteriore pertransibunt.

Upon Mr Leibnits method of transmutations set down in the beginning of his first Answer. a Hæic methodus forma modus transmutatndi figuras curvilineas in alias ipsis æquales ejusdem est generis cum transmutationibus Barrovianis et Gregorianis. Et Conicæ Sectiones hac methodo semper ad series infinitas reduci possunt per divisiones. Idem fit in Curvis secundi generis punctum duplex habentibus, ut & in curvis tertij generis punctum triplem habentibus & in ijs quarti generis puntctum quadruplex habentibus & sic deinceps in infinitum si modo punctum illud inveniatur & pro polo habeatur. In alijs casibus res non succedit, Et ignoto puncto illo duplici vel triplici Methodi in solis conicis sectionibus conicis locutis habet. Methodi Calculo Leibnitiano ad solas sectiones conicas extenditur siquidem Leibnitius ignoratis scilicet punctis Curvarum duplicibus & multiplicibus Methodus non transmutationis formæ quæ d in figuras nonnunquam producit quæ per divisiones quadrari possunt. Atqꝫue idem fit per T Transmutationem Barrovianum Lect. XI. Sect. 24. b Si prima transmutatione res non succedit, frustra tentabitur transmutatio secunda. Porro cum Leibnitius hanc methodum vulgari more prolixius exponat, quam Analysis sua nova paucis exhibere potuisset, manifestum est quod Analysis illa nova ipsi nondum innotuit. Upon his series 1−13+15−17&c, note. Vide pag. 25. lin. 10, & pag. 40 Upon the latter part of his Epistle where he lays claim to some series N.B. Methodum perveniendi ad has series Leibnitius per se invenire non potuit. Eandem Newtonus postulante Leibnitio Epistola Superiore communicaviterat Leibnitius jam tamen series quasdam hac methodo inventas sibi vindicatre jam conatur. Sic et in Actis Leipsiensibus mense Aprili anni 1681 hæc scripsit Or thus. NB. Methodum perveniendi ad has series frustra quæsitam Leibnitius a Newtono acceperat frustra quæsitam jam modo ab Oldenburgo postulaverat, et jam modo a Newtono acceperat.

255,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,Notes on the Newton/Cotes correspondence of 1710,MS Add. 9597/2/18/79-80,c 1713,England,"['English', 'Latin', 'French']","79 By the a parcel of Letters which passed between me & Mr Cotes while he was writing the second Edition of the Principles, I find that the first 28 sheets of th of that Edition ending waith page 224, were printed off before April 15 1710 stylo veteri And this I note that you may know that the alterations made in those sheets had no relation to the disputes about the method of fluxions but preceded them all ,. except that I caused the sheet In order to a third Edition I had have made an addit added to the XVIIth Proposition Lib. 1 the following words . Nam si corpus in his casibus revolvatur in Conica Sectione sic inventa, demonstratum est in Prop. XI, XII, & XIII quod vis centripeta erit reciproce ut quadratum distantiæ corporis a centro virium S, ideoqꝫue Linea quæsita PQ recte exhibetur Q.E.F. But I [When Mr N. Bernoulli was in London (which was in Autumn 1712) & told me that there was a falult in the resolution of Prob: III Lib. II, & that he look it be in trule of finding a mistakmistake in second differences; I answered that I would examin & tooldtold him the next time I saw him (which was within a day or two) that I had examined it the Resolution & found there was a mistake, but it lay in drawing the tangent of the Arch lC the wrong way from the wrong end of the arch. For the tangents of both arches lC & CG should have been drawn the same way with the motion of the body because they represent the moments of the motion . And I added I that I would cause that sheet to be reprinted. & I gave him also the scheme set right & the calculation suited thereunto, & added that I would cause that sheet to be reprinted. The Book of Principles was writ in about 17 or 18 months, whereof about two months were taken up with journeys, & the Manuscript was sent to the Royal Society in Spring 1686; & the shortness of the time in which I wrote it, makes me not ashamed of having committed some faults & omitting some things These things I mentmeant] which words But I can strike them out if you think it may be better to omit them. Nam vires centripetæ quibus corpus circa centrum S revolvi potest per circa in his Lineis inventis revolvi potest eriunt reciproce ut quadratum distantiæ corporis a centro virium S, per Prop XI, XII, & XIII. Nam demonstratum est in Prop. XI, XII et XIII quod vis centripeta qua corpus in Lineis inventis revolvi potest, sit reciproce ut quadratum distantiæ corporis a centro.

But for the future when ever he represents himself the first inventor of exponential equations he ought at the same time to acknowledge that Mr Newton gave him light into the invention by teaching him the use of dignities whose indices were fract surd or indeterminate. [And whereas he pretends to have enlarged Geometry by Exponential Equations he ought to consider that the indices of all dignities are numbers & where the numbers are fluents, the æquations are Arithmetical & have no place in Geometry. Geometrical quantities may be represented by numbers but are not numbers & Arithmetic may be applyed to the resolution of Geometrical Problems: but such resolutions are only Arithmetical, & have no place in Geometry untill they are demonstrated by Geometrical Proposition & thereby become Geometrical Solutions. Nothing is legally admitted into Geometry Geometry is composed of nothing else then except besides Definitions Axioms Lemmas & Propositions Lemmas & Corollaries demonstrated synthetically, And Analysis is noth whether ancient or modern is only only a mean of resolving Problemes: and the Resolutions ought to be turned into Geometrical Solutions by Compos Geometrical Synthesis or Composition before the Problem Propositions be admitted into Geometry.] Mr Ne Sir MI. Newton in his Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 wrote that he had two methods of resolving Invers Problemes of tangents & such like difficult ones, one of which methods consisted in assuming a Series for any unknown quantity from which the other unknown quantities might easily be conveniently be deduced & in the collection of the homologous terms of the resulting equation, for determining the terms of the assumed series. Mr Leibnitz has some years after published this method as his own claiming to himself the first invention thereof. If remains that he either renounce this claim publickly & acknowledg that MSr I. Newton was the first Innovator or prove that he invented it before 24 Octob. 1676 Sir MI. Newton wrote the said Letter. Sir I. Newton in his said Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 used introduced into Analysis the use of fract surd & indefinite indices of dignities & in his letter of 24 Octob 1676 proposed represented to Mr Leibnitz that use Problem of resolving his methods extended to the resolution of affected æquations involving dignitesies whose indices were fract or surd. Mr Leibnitz in his answer dated 21 June 1677 de mutually desired Mr newton to tell him what he thought of the resolution of æquations involving æquation dignities whose indices were surd indetermined quantities as Mr Newton calls fluents, such as are as in the manner of the following examples such as were the æquations xy+yx=x⁢y & xx+yy=x+y. And these æquations he calls exponential, & has represented to 97. pag. 183. l. 11 In the year 1672 going to Paris he fell acquainted with Mr Hugens & in the beginning of the next year came to London, & in February meeting Dr Pell at Mr Boyles. Pag. 184. l. 1. In the end of February or beginning of March 1672/3 Mr Leibnitz went from London to Paris carrying with him the Logarithmotechnia of Mercator of which Dr Pell had given him notice & kept a correspondence with Mr Oldenburg about Arithmetical matters being hith till June following being hitherto unacquainted with the higher Geometry. But the Horologium Oscillatorum of Mr Hugens being published in April, by the reading first of that book first & then of Paschal's Letters & Gregory of st Vincent's Book de quadratura circuli &c & by the i he became acquainted with this Geometry, & after some intermission of his correspondence with Mr Oldenburg, wrote to him in July 1684 that he had a wonderful Theoreme, which gave &c Pag. 191. l. 12. He found out therefore this new Analysis after Aug. 27 1676. or rather after his being in England which was in October following. Pag. 189. lin. 25. After the words — he wrote for Mr Newton's — add this section. After he began to study the higher geometry he fell upon his Triangulum characteristicum, And & invented many particular Theorems like those of Gregory & Barrow, & went on to his Method founded on his Analytical Tables of Tangents & his Combinatory Art. And this was the top of his skill when he wrote his Letter of 27 Aug. 1676. For in that Letter he said of one part of this Method: Nihil est quod norim in tota Analysi momenti majoris. And of another part: Cujus vim ac potestatem nescio an quisquāam hactenus sic consecutus. Ea vero nihil differt ab Analysi illa suprema ad cujus intima Cartesius non pervenit.

262,Isaac Newton,Mathematics,"Newton's transcription of a letter from Leibniz, c. May 1714",MS Add. 9597/2/18/96,c. May 1714,England,['English'],"96. Sir I am obliged to you as well for the communication of the Letter of the excellent Mr Wotton — as for your obliging offer to mediate a good understanding between Mr Newton & me. It was not I that interrupted it. One Mr Keil inserted something against me in one of your Philosophical Transactions. I was much surprised at it & demanded reparation by a Letter to Dr Sloane Secretary of the Society. Dr Sloane sent me a discourse of Mr Keil where he justified what he said after a manner which reflected even upon my integrity. I took this for a private animosity peculiar to that person without having the least suspicion that the Society & Mr Newton himself took part therein. And not judging it worth the while to enter into a dispute with a man ill instructed in former affairs, & supposing also that Mr Newton himself being better informed of that which had passed, would do me justice, I continued only to demand that satisfaction which was due to me. But I know not by what chichanrychicanery & foul play deceipt some brought it about that this matter was taken as if I were pleading before the Society, & submitted my self to their jurisdiction, which I never thought of. And according to justice they should have let me know that the Society would examin the bottom of this affair & have given me opportunity to declare if I would propose my reasons & if I did not hold any of the Judges for suspected. So they have given sentence, one side only being heard, in such a manner that the nullity is visible. Also I do not at all beleive that the judgment which is given can be taken for a final judgment of the Society. Yet Mr Newton has caused it to be published to the world by a book printed expresly for discrediting me & sent it into Germany into France & into Italy as in the name of the Society. This pretended judgment & this affront done without cause to one of the most ancient members of the Society it self, & who has done it no dishonour, will find but few approvers in the world. And in the Society it self I hope that all the members will not agree to it. The able men among the French, Italians & others disapprove highly of this proceeding & are astonished at it, & I have several Letters upon it in my hands. The proofs produced against me appear to them very short. As for me I have always carried my self with the greatedst respect that could be towards Mr Newton. And tho it appears now that there is great room to doubt whether he knew my invention before he had it from me, yet I have spoken as if he had of himself found something like my method: but being abused by some flatterers ill advised he has taken the liberty to attaqꝫue me in a manner very sensiblye. Judge now, Sir, from what side that should principally come which is requisite to terminate this controversy. I have not yet seen the book published against me being at Vienna which is in the furthest part of Germany where such books come very slowly, & I have not thought it worth the while to send for it by the Post. So I have not yet been able to make such an Apology as the affair requires. But others have already taken care of my reputation. I abhor disobliging disputes among men of Letters & have always ayvoyded them; but at present all means possible have been taken to engage me in them. If the evil could be redressed Sir by your interposition, which you offer so obliginly, I should be very glad; & I am already very much obliged to you for it.",NATP00292,1714-05-01 00:00:00

Let AI be one of them and BI the curve which cuts it at right angles, Because the curve AI is given its subnormal GD will be given, But this subnormal is the subtangent of the curve BI. therefore FE∶EI∷IG∶GD. that is calling AG x and IG y: y·∶−x·∷y∶GD. (here x· must be negative for when y increases x decreases, by this Analogy I got an equation and from the equation I obtain a value of the Latus Rectum. This value of the latus Rectum I put in its Room in the equation which expresses the nature of the curve proposed and I have a new exquationequation expressed by x y and their fluxions which gives the nature of the curve required. For example suppose the curve AI a Parabola whose equation is 2⁢l⁢x=y⁢y then GD=l and y·∶−x·∷y−x·⁢yy=l this value of l being put in the equation for the parabola gives −2⁢x⁢x·⁢yy·=y⁢y and −2⁢x⁢x·=y⁢y· hence a2−x2=12⁢y2 or 2⁢a2−2⁢x2=y2 Hence the curve BI is an Ellipse whose Greater Axis is double in Power to its lesser. If the curves Proposed are Hyperbolas, whose center is C transverse Axis AM=2⁢a, their equation is 2⁢l⁢a⁢x+l⁢x22⁢a=y2 and the Subnormal is l⁢a+l⁢x2⁢a=y2 and y·∶−x·∷y∶l⁢a+l⁢x2⁢a hence l=−2⁢a⁢y⁢x·a+x‾×y· which value of l being put in the equation of the Hyperbola gives −4⁢a2⁢y⁢x⁢x·−2⁢a⁢y⁢x2⁢x·2⁢a×a+x‾×y·=y2 and −x2⁢x·−2⁢a⁢x⁢x·x+a=y⁢y· that is −x⁢x·−a⁢x·+a2⁢x·a+x=y⁢y· or 2⁢a2⁢x·a+x=2⁢x⁢x·+2⁢a⁢x·+2⁢y⁢y· and taking the Fluents we have Fluent 2⁢a2⁢x·a+x + a Given quantity =x2+2⁢a⁢x+y2. From which we draw the followin construction. at the center C Asymptotes CA CE describe the hyperbola LGH whose rectangle inscribed is =2⁢a2. make BF perpendicular to BA and = to it. and make up the rectangle MF in AB take any point N and let NO be a mean proportional between NA and NM, at the center O with the Radius OP whose Square is equal to the rectangle MF minus the Hyperbolick space BNGR describe the Arch PQ and let NG produced meet with it in P the point P will be the curve required. The curve will be an oval Figure whose greatest Ordinate is at A.
